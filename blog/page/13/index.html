  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weblog has been very busy in the last three months, but sadly that mainly involves hundreds and hundreds of spam comments stacked up in a moderation queue. Don&#8217;t they even bother to check if the comments are being blocked? Grrr. Anyway, as a result, if you did post a comment it&#8217;s in the list somewhere, and I&#8217;ll tidy things up eventually. I&#8217;m going to either add some sort of fancy Bayesian filtering/blacklist plugin thing or just make the comments &#8220;member-only&#8221;.</p>

<p>The same problem applies to email. I managed to get a backlog of 14,000 emails at my ISP, again mostly spam.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that things are getting settled after all the overtime, the September crunch at work, the house move, and the exploding home server, I&#8217;ve been meaning to start posting again with one of those <a href="http://www.jennshreve.com/thefblog/2006/10/sorry-i-havent-posted-in-awhile.html">traditional Why I&#8217;ve Not Updated My Blog excuses</a>. Later today. Maybe tomorrow. Just after I&#8217;ve finished what I&#8217;m doing.</p>

<p>Today I read this disturbing account of <a href="http://dailybruin.com/news/articles.asp?id=38958">what can happen at UCLA if you don&#8217;t have a student card with you</a> when using a PC. The embedded video didn&#8217;t play, but I&#8217;m used to that.</p>

<p>Then I saw this horrifying video of the event on the front page of YouTube:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyvrqcxNIFs]</p>

<p>The police repeatedly tazer a screaming student because he can&#8217;t stand up <strong>after being tazered</strong>. Cops threaten to tazer other students who ask for their details.</p>

<p>I hope the staff and students at UCLA stand up and make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just stumbled upon <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/fallacies.htm">this excellent list of logical fallacies</a>. Please print out this list and keep it near the TV so you can play &#8220;Spot The Person Talking Rubbish&#8221;* while watching the news.</p>

<p>I think that all children should be taught about logical fallacies and how to reason properly. I doubt you can get much good from democracy (or even free markets) unless people can tell valid statements from complete nonsense.</p>

<p>Although nowadays it&#8217;s easy to point at Bush and Blair and find horrible examples (&#8220;You are either with us or against us!&#8221;) logical fallacies are used by campaigners on every issue. I&#8217;m sorry to say that some &#8216;sciences&#8217; have rather guilty pasts - the &#8216;dismal science&#8217; of Economics and safety testing using animals spring to mind.</p>

  <br />
  Originally uploaded by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/binaryape/">BinaryApe</a>.

</div>

<p>This little patch of marshy water was the inspiration for a long walk last Sunday. It used to be be larger (you can see the earlier shape of it) and rather significant.</p>

<p>Local folklore says that a mermaid lives in the pool, and if seen at Easter she will grant extended life (or even immortality) to some, and drag others to their deaths under the marshy water. Some story tellers rationalise the mermaid by claiming that the pool is somehow connected to the Atlantic&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s almost certain that this tale is a folkmemory of the earlier religious role of the pool. There&#8217;s evidence that the pool was a Celtic religious site, and the scene of sacrifice (some articles hint at human sacrifice, and one I can&#8217;t find anymore talked of the broken sword ritual)  The Celts viewed standing water as a connection between this world and others.  They also had a fear of bogland as a fearsome, haunted, wild area. Burial in bogland was a way of sending people to another world and preventing them from returning.</p>

<p>This pool is almost directly beneath the waterfall, and surrounded by the curve of cliffs that mark the boundary between this world (trees, sheep, fields, people) and the otherworld of the high moor above (wind, bog, stones, spirits). It&#8217;s a place to mediate between both worlds.</p>

<p>When the folktale talks of a mermaid who grants life or takes life at Easter, the start of the old year, it doesn&#8217;t take much imagination to realise what probably went on in the shallow water of that pool.</p>

<p>The mermaid lives on, even beyond the occasional visits of folklorist, neo Pagans and Forteans to the pool. Well and spring ceremonies still continue in many town and villages in the Pennines, often closely associated with the Virgin Mary, Christianity&#8217;s new name for the Mermaid.</p>

<p>I should add that the modern day inhabitants of Hayfield are exceptionally nice and quite unlikely to perform human sacrifices in bogs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From <a href="http://normblog.typepad.com/normblog/2006/05/a_beginning.html">Normblog</a>, the weblog of a political academic and supposed leader of the Blairite intelligentsia:</p>

<blockquote>
The first of these: 9/11 - September 11, 2001. It is a day imprinted on the public memory - indelibly - because the crime committed in New York and Washington DC announced a terrible willingness, of which few previously had been aware: a willingness to use terror without limit for political ends; a terrorism, that is to say, unconstrained by any concern about the numbers of the innocent dead. That day was both an end and a beginning because it showed, and to many of us in an instant, that the world was now different, dangerously so, and in a way not amenable to simple-minded responses.
</blockquote>

<p>I think I could easily write 2000 words just on that paragraph alone, but it&#8217;s hardly worth it. All the same, two key things that rise to the surface are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Blairite obsession with History. They once believed opposition to the invasion of Iraq would fade after a quick victory and the creation of a wonderful new Iraq.  We whingers would hang our heads in shame over our cowardly doubts, and history would record Blair as The Great Strong Leader Who Saved Iraq. As the utter carnage in Iraq continues, the entire region destablises, and more facts about the &#8216;planning&#8217; of the invasion emerge, it looks as if they&#8217;ll be remembered with all the fondness of Nixon and Kissinger. As a result there is a desperate scramble to hang on to the history that didn&#8217;t happen, a strange parallel world where the people of Iraq are enjoying Liberty rather than suffering in The State of Nature.</p></li>
<li><p>The writer&#8217;s astonishing lack of self awareness. This person is supposed to be a <i>thinker</i>, but writes things like the above without any apparent realisation of what he&#8217;s actually written. &#8220;&#8230; a willingness to use terror without limit for political ends; a terrorism, that is to say, unconstrained by any concern about the numbers of the innocent dead&#8221; - who is he writing about again? He accuses the anti-war &#8220;left&#8221; of repeating their mistake of being apologists for the crimes of communist states, while he himself is desperately trying to excuse the actions of Blair and Bush using the exact same rationalisation process!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The entire <a href="http://eustonmanifesto.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=38">Euston Manifesto</a> appears to be a bundle of weak apologist rhetoric and obvious logical fallacies tied together with frayed string and decorated with buzzwords ( &#8216;Open Source&#8217; indeed!). It has more straw men than a scarecrow festival.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve long thought that the Socialist Workers Party were wilfully naive, but the Euston Manifesto gang are true masters, publishers of smug auto-satirical wibble. A world &#8220;not amenable to simple-minded responses&#8221;, eh?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A worthwhile pledge at PledgeBank:</p>

<blockquote>
Nicholas Negroponte has previewed of the $100 laptop that he has designed for students in the developing world. &#8221; One Laptop Per Child - a Preview of the Hundred Dollar Laptop http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/00&#8230; &#8221;

The suggestion has been made that he also offer it for sale for ~$300 to the rest of us so that we do have an interesting machine and can help to support the cost computers for the developing world. If he does offer it, then I will buy one at three times the cost and thus contribute to supplying two to the proposed users.

<p>I was hoping this would be possible so to make it more likely I&#8217;ve signed up.</p>
