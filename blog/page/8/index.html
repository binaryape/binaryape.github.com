  <div class="entry-content"><p>So then, it seems that:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s OK to bomb a state TV station (killing journalists) because they were<em> showing propaganda</em> (Serbia&#8217;s RTS)
It&#8217;s OK to bomb independent TV stations (killing journalists) because they were <em>showing propaganda</em>. (Al Jazeera)</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not OK to legally withdraw a broadcast license for a TV station (without killing the journalists) that <em>shows propaganda</em>. And was involved in a coup against a democratically elected government. (RCTV) Doing that would be terrible blow against freedom of speech! (RCTV can now only be seen on cable)</p>

<p>This &#8216;act of revenge&#8217; by Chavez is years after the attempted coup, so it would definitely be a dish served cold. How long would an Al Qaeda funded and staffed TV station remain on air in the USA or UK?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not one of the many people who idolise Hugo Chavez (I think he&#8217;s a demagogue and thug) but there seems to be a rather disproportionate media outcry against his withdrawal of a broadcast license for RCTV. Even<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/27/venezuelan_media_cra.html"> BoingBoing is joining in</a>.</p>

<p>[When NATO bombed RTS I was working in a British TV studio building. Did the RTS technicians and hairdressers deserve to die any more than the ones I passed in the corridor? Not renewing a broadcast license is rather mild in comparison.]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://playlist.yahoo.com/makeplaylist.dll?sid=37208649&amp;sdm=web&amp;qtw=640&amp;qth=400">&#8216;His Dark Materials: Northern Lights&#8217; trailer!</a>  Woo! (Well, it&#8217;s  &#8216;The Golden Compass&#8217; now, following the book&#8217;s American title, and not quite the same as the book, but definitely Woo all the same.)</p>

<p>It looks good, but I&#8217;m still concerned: I&#8217;ve been wondering how they&#8217;ll convincingly show a talking polar bear (lets face it, they don&#8217;t have the jaw, teeth lips, etc for it it look &#8220;normal&#8221;) and I&#8217;m still not convinced from the trailer. Where are all the demon animals? I thought the Texan balloonist was younger&#8230;  But I&#8217;m still eagerly looking forward to this. At the very least it should encourage more people to enjoy the books. Pullman himself has said &#8220;All the important scenes are there and will have their full value.&#8221; Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>(Via <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/weblog/2007/05/22/his_dark_materials.html">His Dark Materials from Ben Hammersley</a>)
[I too will be very surprised if they get away with showing one particular small scene in the third book. Although I&#8217;m hoping it might make it to a DVD extended edition :-)]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The lights at home did some disturbing flickering last week, so I&#8217;ve started thinking about replacing my dead UPS.</p>

<p>A basic UPS can handle about 400w. My PC&#8217;s power supply can provide up to 450w, but how much does it actually use?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve now got a gadget that connects between a plug and mains socket and gives a live reading of the watts being consumed. Power usage on the PC ranges from 90w to 120w. It was fascinating to see power consumption rise while email was being downloaded. We tend to think of the virtual activity within computer networks being completely distinct from the real world, but in reality even an email attachment has a carbon footprint.</p>

<p>There was one disturbing discovery. The PSU is a recently bought Antec HE, an ATX2.2 &#8216;high efficiency&#8217; power supply. It gives off less heat, and has an 85% efficiency. This is all very good, and might well account for the lower than expected power usage. Unfortunately the power meter showed that when the PC was turned off using the soft-power button, and should have been almost completely off, it was still consuming <strong>20w</strong>! Twenty watts is quite a lot of power for what I assumed was a small circuit to detect a powerup request. To put it in context, a Nintendo Wii games console uses less than 20w when being used to play a game. The PC was doing nothing.</p>

<p>I normally avoid &#8216;standby&#8217; modes and had no idea I was wasting so much power. I&#8217;ve now set the PC to boot when &#8216;power is restored&#8217; and then switch it off at the &#8216;hard&#8217; switch too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While the general trend is for more products to become veggie friendly, even vegan, Mars have changed their recipes to include rennet, stomach juice from animals. From 1 May 2007 many of their most common pseudo-chocolates are no longer veggie.</p>

<p>To their credit Mars did contact The Vegetarian Society to warn them, so at least they are being fair and honest about this.</p>

<p>Link:  <a href="http://www.scouseveg.co.uk/2007/04/30/mars-confectionary-no-longer-vegetarian/#comment-20805">ScouseVeg ¬ª Mars confectionary no longer vegetarian</a></p>

<p>(Footrant: I stopped eating any confectionary that wasn&#8217;t organic or fair trade over ten years ago. Mass-market chocolate production involves slavery, pollution and violence. Vegetarians should avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Chocolate">Big Chocolate</a> products because they&#8217;re made by child slaves, not just because they&#8217;re made with rennet. Most Mars, Cadbury and Nestle &#8216;chocolate&#8217; products are utter junk anyway.)</p>

<p>This is a photo I took today of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_(fish)">pike</a> in a Manchester canal.<br />
<br />
Before spotting the pike I&#8217;d been reading &#8216;A Wizard of Earthsea&#8217;, in which the main character&#8217;s &#8216;true name&#8217; is Ged. According to Wikipedia an old English name for pike is &quot;ged&quot;. A nice coincidence.<br />
<br />
Many years ago I got to eat some pike caught in a Warwickshire river, cooked with lemon juice. It tasted like river mud with lemon juice. <br />
<br />
(I&#8217;ve just remembered how much sewage ended up in that river. Bleugh.)

<p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mvvg/">Manchester Vegetarian and Vegan Group</a>  held a chocolate tasting event and asked me to take a few photos.</p>

<p>In the end I took 105 pictures, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/binaryape/sets/72157600024099618/">with about 64 usable ones</a> - I&#8217;m a point-and-clicker rather than a Serious Photographer With A Serious Camera.</p>

<p>The chocolate was great, ranging from expensive fancy, handmade stuff to vegan white chocolate and Jaffa Cake clones. All the chocolate had been generously donated by a long list of companies. There was a huge pile of rather good vegan fudge, raw chocolate tea, cakes and marzipan bars. The chocolate fountain decided to behave more like one of those volcanic mud pools in New Zealand, bubbling away rather than flowing, but it worked well enough.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a veggie in Manchester then I would <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mvvg/">recommend joining MVVG&#8217;s mailing list</a> - they&#8217;re a nice group, the list often has interesting and useful info and you&#8217;ll get the opportunity to experience all-you-can-eat vegan chocolate events :-)</p>

<p>(I&#8217;m still humming the music from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abIJ2MPtWOk">Homer&#8217;s chocolate daydream</a>)</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samh101/431732104/">Linux : the myth and the reality</a>

Ouch. I think <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/samh101/">Sam&#8217;s</a> been a little too harsh, but <a href="http://cdn.novell.com/cached/video/bs_07/mac_pc_linux.mpg">Novell&#8217;s video</a> was a bit&#8230; awkward. I like the point (there&#8217;s more than just Windows vs Mac) but in an advert with a dull, inadequate Windows person and smug hipster Mac person, the Linux person should really have had a beard, worn a Think Geek shirt, and not actually said anything. Why have two stereotypes when you can have three?</div>

<blockquote>Matthew Huntbach takes a long hard look at the coolest language on the planet and is distinctly under impressed by what he sees‚Ä¶</blockquote>

<p>That introduction has more than a slight aroma of flamebait. In the actual article Mr Huntbach concludes:</p>

<blockquote>Despite what I‚Äôve written above, I didn‚Äôt find Ruby horrible. If I needed to use a scripting language, it‚Äôs the one I would now use. It‚Äôs cleaner than Perl, and I like its syntax better than Python. Its object-based nature works for me: object-orientation is not the silver bullet, but it is a better abstraction for managing complexity and modelling things than anything else we have. It has picked up some useful aspects from functional programming as well and put them into a language whose ability to handle interaction between stateful objects makes it more practical than pure functional programming (still to me, real elegance, but of an infuriating kind). But it isn‚Äôt as revolutionary or as cool as its advocates suppose.</blockquote>

<p>I can&#8217;t disagree with that at all. Ruby is generating a lot of hype because it can trigger great enthusiasm from the hordes of recently converted PHP and Java programmers. Ruby can also support trendy new paradigms like meta-programing, <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">BDD</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_programming_language">domain-specific languages</a> with ease, so tends to get caught up in all the Cool New Development trends. It&#8217;s zeitgeisty!</p>

<p>Skip over the academic language snobbery (that&#8217;s a whole topic in itself&#8230;) and there&#8217;s nothing really objectionable about the article at all. I find the description of a conference full of programing academics quivering with confusion about the ungodly goings on the real world rather amusing.  <em>People are using </em><strong><em>scripting</em></strong><em> languages!</em> <em>Oh my goodness! Why won&#8217;t they listen to us?</em></p>

<p>I disagree with Matthew Huntbach&#8217;s criticism of Ruby&#8217;s array handling as unintuitive, however.</p>

<blockquote>I‚Äôll give just a couple of examples. In Ruby, if a is [1,2,3] and b is [10,20,30], then a+b is [1,2,3,10,20,30]. Why not [11,22,33], which Tim Sweeney in an earlier article suggests &#8220;intuitively makes sense&#8221;? What does a[x,y] (when a is a two-dimensional array) mean in Ruby? Not what I first supposed it might mean from other languages (otherwise a[x][y]), or even what I then thought it might mean (otherwise a[x..y]).</blockquote>

<p>The plus sign has this functionality for Ruby arrays (all operators are just object methods in Ruby):</p>

<p><code>[1, 2, 3]  +  [4, 5, 6]
=&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] - [3, 1, 6]
=&gt; [2, 4, 5]</code>
<code>[ 1, 2, 3 ] * 3
=&gt; [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]</code>
Ruby&#8217;s array is a<em> list</em> that can contain any mix of objects. The plus operator is a method acting on the list object, not its contents. The least surprising results of adding two lists is a longer list, hence the default, sugary behaviour of plus.</p>

<p>Matthew Huntbach would get the behaviour he wanted by using the correct classes, Vector and Matrix.</p>

<p><code>a = Vector[1, 2, 3]
b = Vector[4, 5, 6]
a + b
=&gt; [5, 7, 9]</code>
If you want to apply a method to the <em>contents</em> of an object, use a map or collection method. Ruby excels at this. One of the reasons Ruby makes me happy is that its array handling is so much more convenient than Perl&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Ruby&#8217;s behaviour will not always be &#8220;intuitive&#8221; if you&#8217;ve spent years working with C based languages, but I think this more often just down to unlearning old habits than flaws in the language itself.  Ruby quite deliberately dumps the non-OOP baggage of C based languages. Ruby was written as a replacement for Perl but is not conceptually descended from Perl, or from C. Its <em>purpose</em> was modelled on Perl, but it&#8217;s ancestry is more closely linked to Lisp and Smalltalk.</p>

<p>Although I think Ruby succeeded in following the principle of least surprise<em> in most cases</em> its fundamental differences from the C based languages do cause a few points of confusion. My own favourite is Ruby&#8217;s evaluation of &#8220;truthiness&#8221;.</p>

<p>In most C-based languages 0, &#8220;&#8221;, undefined are false. Anything else is true.</p>

<p><code>$result = 0;
print "Hello" if $result;
=&gt;</code>
In Ruby only Falseclass and Nilclass are false. Any other defined object is true, including 0 and empty strings.</p>

<p><code>result = 0
print "Hello" if result
=&gt; "hello"</code>
(Both approaches are justifiable but I&#8217;m now happier with Ruby&#8217;s approach. 0 and &#8220;&#8221; are still, present valid data. In my contrived example above 0 is still a result)</p>

<p>Another gotcha is that every named variable is effectively containing a reference to the actual object. By default assignment copies the reference, not the object.</p>

<p><code>a = "HELLO"
b = a
a =&gt; "HELLO"
b =&gt; "HELLO"</p>

<p>a.downcase!
a =&gt; 'hello'
b =&gt; 'hello'</code>
This is rarely a problem but occasional use of .dup is required.</p>

<blockquote>This all coming from a guy whose current interest is the Aldwych programming language.</blockquote>

<p>Ouch.</p>
