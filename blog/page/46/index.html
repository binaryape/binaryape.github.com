  <div class="entry-content"><p>Plodding on for a couple of hours every night now, and enjoying it immensely. Somehow, refactoring code is a nice way to spend an evening. Not the nicest, I hasten to add. I&#8217;m learning a lot, and Hippo is looking good inside and out.</p>

<p>Hippo isn&#8217;t quite a Content Management System (CMS). It&#8217;s more about meta-content than content, but it&#8217;s inspired by great software such as those listed on the sites below:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cmsinfo.org/">CMSInfo</a> - a site listing many Open Source CMS systems.
<a href="http://www.opensourcecms.com/"> Open Source CMS</a> - another OSS CMS portal</p>

<p>In particular Hippo is influenced by the sadly relicensed <a href="http://www.metadot.com">Metadot</a> and the absolutely wonderful <a href="http://www.plainblack.com/">WebGUI</a>. It&#8217;ll do things rather differently though - Hippo has a different role.  In fact, I&#8217;m wondering if I can get it to work alongside WebGUI&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How most  &#8220;news&#8221; stories are born:</p>

<p>1) Organisation writes &#8220;controversial&#8221; press release and sends it to journalists
2) Journalist cuts and pastes, does a bit of editing, maybe adds the word &#8220;claim&#8221;
3) Mainstream media story is published.</p>

<p>In a previous job I occassionally edited and released press releases for my employer. I was suprised to see them lightly re-written and printed by newspapers as reports, with nothing to indicate that it was actually a press release. I&#8217;d expected them to contact us for more information, or contact other people involved, or just do some actual work.  I&#8217;ve since learned that this is quite normal, in fact, much of the mainstream news media simply reformats events sent them by &#8220;interested parties&#8221; - people with an agenda - and publishes.  If we&#8217;re lucky the report originates with a news agency:  one story sent to many papers and edited a bit. The true investigative reporter is a rare and wonderful creature.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s therefore rather amusing that the BBC have published an article attacking Google and blogs (in which they claim that old media is more reliable and trustworthy) by simply basing it on a website run by people trying to discredit Google for their own gain. Tom Coates has a <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/02/the_ostrich_of_journalism.shtml">good article and discussion on this</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s common knowledge among rat owners that tofu is bad for rats. Soy protein itself or very cooked tofu isn&#8217;t too bad, but raw tofu should be avoided. As rats are used for experiments, a lot of work has been done in studying rats&#8217; responses to various factors. Just as chocolate and aspirin are very bad for dogs, tofu is bad for rats. It&#8217;s not news, and it&#8217;s easy to prove with a few unpleasant experiments on poor rats.</p>

<p>Tofu is rather good for humans. Vast amounts of it are consumed by people in countries with healthy populations. Vast amounts of soymilk are also consumed. Vegans in the west have also been consuming a lot of soy for many years. Large scale studies have uncovered no adverse effects of soy consumption in humans, although vegan kids do tend to be lighter, slimmer and slightly shorter as they&#8217;ve not consumed the extra hormones in cow milk.</p>

<p>A recent <strike>press release</strike> news story appeared in many papers and websites, under a shock headline warning pregnant women to avoid soya. A team of scientists had discovered that soy makes rats infertile! They warned women to avoid soy  products until further study. Some of the articles mentioned that China wasn&#8217;t exactly known for infertility, but still ran under a  scary headline.  A UK government committee has taken this warning to heart, and gave the story greater weight.</p>

<p>The story had about as much strength as a claim that chocolate is deadly poison to humans.It&#8217;s almost certainly  just an attempt to get funding by whipping up a scare story, but some believe the meat and dairy industry are desperate to find something unhealthy about plant based diets. People who feel guilty eating meat but who don&#8217;t want to give it up also find consolation in these scare stories.</p>

<p>The soy &#8220;estrogen&#8221; scare is even in  a database of <a href="http://hoaxinfo.com/soya.htm">known email hoaxes</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a vast amount of evidence that meat and dairy foods are the biggest causes of death and illness after smoking, particularly via heart disease and cancer.  Dairy products are contain (amongst other things) natural but non-human hormones. Children eating western diets are showing far greater signs of sex hormone problems than children on eastern diets. Are the press and government advising people to avoid meat? A little bit.*</p>

<p>If there is a risk in tofu, it&#8217;s very, very small, far less obvious than the many clear, proven  benefits. If a problem doesn&#8217;t show up in a sample like the Chinese population, it&#8217;s not exactly major.</p>

<p>The link below is to a decent and quite balanced document by the UK&#8217;s Vegan Society. It looks like soy isn&#8217;t good for parrots either.</p>

<p>*Government warnings about the dangers of eating fish are rather worrying,   and I don&#8217;t even eat fish. Our seas are seriously polluted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://www.ds2.pg.gda.pl/~colan/screenplay.htm">&#8216;The Matrix&#8217;</a>, Thomas Anderson has a short and neat, if rather cliched online name. Which was fortunate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson? That is the sound of inevitability. That is the sound of your death. Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My&#8230; name&#8230; is&#8230; <a href="http://perceptionss.diaryland.com/030131_60.html">chunkylover53</a>!&#8221;</p>

<p>I really enjoyed The Matrix. I can forgive its vast, gaping plot holes. While I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing the next one, I really hope the sequel isn&#8217;t just a remix of the original. Watching the <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/">recent trailer</a>, one scene looked a little too much like the original&#8217;s  foyer fight. Also, Neo&#8217;s new outfit reminds me of Father Ted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,875191,00.html">very briefly mentioned</a> in The Guardian a couple of weeks ago in an article on the <a href="http://www.lazyweb.org">Lazyweb</a> idea. This is my first appearance outside the Guardian&#8217;s letters page.  I admit it: I&#8217;ve written letters to the Guardian, just one small step away from writing letters to Home Truths. Which I have to confess, I listen to every weekend. I also plan to grow a proper beard one day, but I digress.</p>

<p>A relatively large website which I struggled to maintain way back in the mid-1990s was once Slashdotted, back in the days when that meant something*, and was later recommended as reading material to the USA&#8217;s Department of Justice in <a href="http://lists.essential.org/1998/info-policy-notes/msg00031.html">a letter</a>  by Ralph Nader and James Love. I&#8217;m still quite proud of this. Alas, the pressures of fame, Claris HomePage and my site&#8217;s god-awful colour scheme  proved too much for me, and I passed the site on to someone else, and retired with the $40 of Amazon Associate fees I&#8217;d earned. I let the dotcom bubble pass me by, (which wasn&#8217;t difficult) and focused on my day job and reading a dangerous number of  O&#8217;Reilly books.</p>

<p>*Back before the term was actually used, I suspect, which makes that statement mean even less.</p>
