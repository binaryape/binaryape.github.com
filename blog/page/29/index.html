  <div class="entry-content"><p>An award winning animation for children about a dog  poo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once upon a time, a little doggy poo lived on the side of a road. He felt all alone in the world. He believed that nobody needed him for anything, and that he had no purpose in life. If only Doggy Poo had a reason for being, then he wouldn&#8217;t give up on his dream to be useful to the world.</p>

<p>One day, Doggy Poo meets a lovely dandelion sprout. Will she explain his purpose in life? Will she help make his dream come true?&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There have been no posts here from me for a while, as my old PC failed, then after I&#8217;d put together a new one,  I decided to try to really focus on getting a completely new version of Fljud out. It&#8217;s now two years since the original hacky little script was put on Sourceforge. I&#8217;ve failed to get a new one out in time for the anniversary. I&#8217;m still bogged down in the back-end library side of things, and having sleepy, dull headaches from the muggy weather, and being distracted by &#8216;Prince of Persia&#8217; on the Gamecube. It&#8217;s no Zelda, but it&#8217;s still rather good.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to get in a couple of hours work each evening, and this week was meant to use up some vacation days in a blaze of programing productivity. So far, that hasn&#8217;t happened - I&#8217;ve been stuck on some problems, with a non-functioning brain. However, the huge cake from <a href="http://www.earthcafe.co.uk/">The Earth Cafe</a> was very, very nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Is Manchester&#8217;s postal delivery service particularly bad, or is it just that Newcastle&#8217;s is quite good?</p>

<p>How can a &#8220;First Class&#8221; parcel take over five days (still counting&#8230;) to be delivered to a central Manchester address?</p>

<ul>
<li>Despite appearances Manchester is quite a distant and difficult place to find</li>
<li>The postman has just left the parcel next to the building&#8217;s front door as he did last time*, only this time someone has stolen it</li>
<li>Because I complained about that, the parcel is on a shelf labelled &#8220;Wait a week&#8221;</li>
<li>Since <a href="http://momorgan.com/archives/2004/07/13/7eea696a72e64cb69dcf6376dc9f64d0/">First Class is the new Second Class</a>, it&#8217;s just been lost</li>
<li><a href="http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/news/s/127/127138_letters_dumped_in_bin_by_a_temp_.html">It&#8217;s in a dog-dirt bin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To answer the question, I&#8217;ve talked to friends and relatives in Manchester, and it does look as if residential deliveries aren&#8217;t particularly good, particularly for flat-dwellers.</p>

<p>Link: <a href="http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/news/s/127/127138_letters_dumped_in_bin_by_a_temp_.html">&#8220;Angry CWU representatives believe post is often being delivered by people who do not care whether it reaches the correct destination on time.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://momorgan.com/archives/2004/07/13/7eea696a72e64cb69dcf6376dc9f64d0/">another late/lost presents rant.</a></p>

<ul>
<li>I was at home too - he didn&#8217;t bother to ring the bell, or leave it with a neighbour. Or leave a card in my postbox saying &#8220;Left parcel next to front door where about 100 people will walk past it&#8221;. I just happened to notice it when I was leaving.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still, <a href="http://scaryduck.blogspot.com/2004/08/mirth-and-woe-ducks-brother-writes.html">it might eventually arrive. At least I&#8217;ve not broken my rib</a>.</p>

<p>[Victor Meldew style rants are now only permitted when supported by something vaguely useful or informative, or just a couple of links.]</p>

<p><b>Update:</b>
Mea culpa, a bit. I have now got the parcel: there was a letter in my postbox today (Friday) saying that they&#8217;d tried to deliver it on Monday. I&#8217;d given up waiting on Monday as I needed to go shopping, and left at about 4.40pm. Delivery turned up around 4.50pm. Grrrr. So it was fast, it just wasn&#8217;t left with the block management or neighbours, and I wasn&#8217;t told until four days later. I also got a letter for a business down the road today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;The Church of England is calling on the Royal Mail to limit the design of Christmas stamps to Christian themes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since people in Britain have been celebrating Yule with old, shamanic, Father Christmas symbols for a few thousand years longer than Christianity has existed, that&#8217;s a bit cheeky.  There&#8217;s very, very little Christian content in <b>any</b> of Britain&#8217;s festivals, and it&#8217;s never been any different.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear Odeon,</p>

<p>In December 2002 I wrote a small article on my website, describing how astonishingly badly written the Odeon website was. I was unable to use your your website at all. Using most browsers, your website is simply the word &#8220;Odeon&#8221;. I went to the local UCI instead.</p>

<p>In August 2003, I discovered a way to use your site: via the efforts of a good designer, Mr Somerville, someone who clearly understands how to use the web. I visited the Odeon again.</p>

<p>Now I can no longer access your information, as you have decided to threaten Mr Somerville for giving people access to your site.</p>

<p>Your marketing director appears to possess the same effectiveness as your website designers.</p>

<p>I will now be boycotting the Odeon cinemas.</p>

<p>Link: <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/odeon/">Accessible Od*on</a></p>

<p>(Is this a sort of viral-anti-marketing campaign? Or are Mac OS X and Linux users not wanted at the Odeon? &#8220;Oi! We don&#8217;t want you smart-arse types in here! Clear off and take your fancy glasses and film analysis with you!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s easy to blame outside factors when your network systems go a bit odd, but it&#8217;s a good idea to make sure it really isn&#8217;t your stuff that&#8217;s gone decidedly weird first. So this morning, some of my colleagues and I spent a while prodding our DNS servers with a stick* to see why Google, Apple and Yahoo domains kept bouncing up and down. The common factor was that they all used Akamai&#8217;s DNS.</p>

<p>It looks like our theory was correct: <a href="http://isc.incidents.org/diary.php?date=2004-06-15&amp;isc=d1aa327ef03fb64cbb38ea8235d4f30c">Akamai DNS problem affected large sites</a></p>

<p>The worrying aspect of this is that so many large sites were depending on one company. The title of this Metafilter item is very apt: <a href="http://www.metafilter.org/mefi/33701">A Couple of Large Pieces, Joined at the Hip</a>** Commercial pressures are making the Internet&#8217;s low level structure too linear and prone to failures, and software and service monocultures (Apache and Bind for instance) are weakening the higher levels.</p>

<p>Or maybe I just worry about these things too much.</p>

<p>(* Not literally.)
(** As opposed to the design ideal of <a href="http://www.smallpieces.com/">&#8216;small pieces, loosely joined&#8217;</a>)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since someone was either trolling or honestly offended by the item I wrote a couple of years ago about me realising my own growing snobbishness &#8220;It&#8217;s Grim Up North (Shields)&#8221;, I&#8217;ve removed it. I&#8217;ve got nothing against goths or large men with tattoos. (I do have something against cinema websites with incorrect information though).  I just can&#8217;t be bothered responding anymore. The title of the item referred to a cartoon strip in Private Eye, the target of the item&#8217;s criticism was <i>me</i>, written when I&#8217;d been having a bad time.</p>
