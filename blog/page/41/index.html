  <div class="entry-content"><p>If only I&#8217;d just waited!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/">Bricolage</a>
A very successful Open Source CMS. Bricolage runs many popular websites and frequently beats expensive proprietary CMSs in reviews. Bricolage is very different to Hippo: it&#8217;s a top-down publishing tool for managing magazine and news sites based around articles, while Hippo is about small communities trading chunks of information. All the same, it&#8217;s too impressive to miss in this CMS round-up.</p>

<p><a href="http://tikiwiki.sourceforge.net/">Tiki</a>
Startlingly close to what I originally intended Hippo to be, and still so close* that  <b>I&#8217;m</b> tempted to use it rather than Hippo.  Tiki has a large team of clearly talented developers, and if I was going to get competitive I wouldn&#8217;t stand a chance. I&#8217;ll just pilfer a couple of their ideas instead. Hippo is weirder though, I&#8217;ll say that.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloki.com/">Bloki</a>
A blog hosting service with wiki-like features, something which is a Good Thing and Hippo-bound for a while. The combination of subscription based hosting with blogging software seems to be getting rather popular - <a href="http://www.20six.co.uk/-/en/home/default.htm">20six</a> launched an English version of their service this week, and other companies are moving into this area. I&#8217;m not sure if Hippo could do this - it&#8217;s meant for small groups of people, only a few hundred at most.</p>

<p>*I&#8217;m comparing a real working application to something that&#8217;s 70% vapourware here, which is a bit cheeky I know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something Interesting Happens In Tamworth Shock!</p>

<p>&#8220;I will never forget that terrible stare. I immediately thought, &#8216;That&#8217;s not right&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not want any of my friends to be treated like those Iraqis on the photographs. We are a great nation. But we would lose our self-respect and much more besides if we allowed ourselves and our troops to stoop this low.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well done Kelly Tilford.</p>

<p>The key issue is not so much whether or not people commit crimes, it&#8217;s what happens next - whitewash, denial, or honest investigation. Some civilians are criminals, some soldiers are criminals, and the state can&#8217;t really stop that. The role of the state is to deal with the problem well, and I hope that happens here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Plan A was to write a shallow prototype that was almost just a mockup, then, after finalising features and design, start work on the real program. I planned to throw one away.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m deeply buried in Plan B, which more closely matches Microsoft&#8217;s development spiral. I didn&#8217;t intend to do this, but it suits me better. I&#8217;m now on the third rewrite of Hippo. The amount of change a user sees across the three versions in quite small, but the amount of library functionality is much, much bigger. I seem to be writing a contruction kit rather than the actual app. Good or bad? I&#8217;m not sure. Either way it&#8217;s a good learning experience, and I get a lot of code to reuse in other projects.</p>

<p>Hippo is now properly multi-user, although without any security yet - the ACL methods just say &#8220;yeah, OK&#8221; to all checks. The vapourware portion has grown a little too, but the feature set is now pretty stable. No iceberg in sight yet - the idea seems to work.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s about time I actually added the useful bits, and condensed some vapour&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks after Christmas, while I was travelling into work on the Newcastle Metro, I noticed that the man sitting opposite me was reading a book on Go. I hadn&#8217;t played Go for years. When I was about 14 my eldest sister was given the MB Games Go set, and a few years later I used Older Brother powers to nick it. It went off to University with me, and I continued to play (rather badly) there too.</p>

<p>At some point I misplaced the Go set (I suspect Alison reclaimed it), and then rarely played Go for years - occassionally I would play a computer version. I intended to get a new board and learn to play properly, but other things pushed it back. I also couldn&#8217;t find a board in shops, I couldn&#8217;t find any other players either.</p>

<p>I got chatting with the Go  man, and he recommended a couple of books. One Amazon order later, I started learning how to play properly, and took the book with me on my journey to work.</p>

<p>While I was reading the book in an overcrowded carriage, the guy sitting next to me, who I had never met before, said &#8220;You play Go? I haven&#8217;t played Go for ages&#8221;. We had a brief chat about Go and board games before I left at my stop with the location of some Go retailers.</p>

<p>I only know one person who&#8217;s played Go before meeting me, and people on the Metro don&#8217;t usually talk to strangers at all, but somehow I&#8217;d had two chats with keen Go players within a few weeks. I swapped roles in the second conversation. Odd. I wonder if the pattern continued?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Mr Weaver said there was no need for people to start fearing an onslaught of badger attacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m childishly amused by people who go for short walks in the Lake District, in warm weather, along managed paths, laden with hundreds of pounds-worth of boots, multilayer survival garments, multiple maps, flasks, and odd walking sticks. It&#8217;s best to be careful if climbing a difficult hill in changeable weather, but I often joke that someone in suburbia is telling tales of giant bear-like badgers, packs of terrible man-hunting foxes, and moles that can drag a full-grown man to his doom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you packed the fox-repellent spray dear?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;ve sharpened the anti-badger stick too. Remember poor George, they only found his feet.&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll pack the flare gun too, just in case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, now a real badger has now gone on a violent suburban rampage, I expect walkers with tasers and bayonets.</p>

<p>The poor thing was killed, but he managed to chew up a man&#8217;s arm rather badly and chase policemen, so a dog wouldn&#8217;t have expected anything better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To define a group, you have to create two groups: those in the group, and those outside. Every group depends on discrimination, what anthropologists refer to as &#8220;the other&#8221;.</p>

<p>The Conservative Party should be able to prohibit Labour Party members from joining. The Vegetarian Society should be able to refuse membership to a dedicated carnivore, men should be excluded from women&#8217;s changing rooms.  Some discrimination is justified.</p>

<p>On the other hand, context is important, and a lot of discrimination is unjustified. Should my religion or sexuality be grounds for discrimination when I look for work?</p>

<p>The 2003 Employment Equality Regulations were intended to counter workplace discrimination, and to comply with European directives. However, it looks as if Tony Blair has directly intervened to add a loophole for &#8220;religious organisations&#8221;.</p>

<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be a problem if the context was sensible. Few people would argue against allowing The Church of England to dismiss a vicar if he decided to become an atheist, or a Hindu; the vicar&#8217;s religion is clearly a relevant requirement for his employment by The Church of  England.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the revised regulations are very vague. They seem to apply to not just religious organisations, but any organisations run by &#8220;religious&#8221; people. According to The Independant:</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the biggest loopholes allows an employer to dismiss or fail to hire an individual if he is &#8220;not satisfied&#8221; that they fit his own &#8220;ethos based on religion or belief&#8221;.&#8221;</p>

<p>If true (and I&#8217;m still stuggling to believe something this crazy is true) then  the scope of legal discrimination will be almost infinite: someone working for a bank could be fired for being a Catholic, or &#8220;not being Christian enough&#8221;, or reading Harry Potter books.</p>

<p>Some discrimination is required by employers, but this loophole would allow outrageous abuses.</p>

<p>This morning I read that someone is selling car stickers printed with &#8220;I voted for Blair, but I got Bush&#8221;. This morning, that was funny.</p>
