<p>It feels as if <a href="http://www.itv.co.uk">ITV </a>have been saying that <a href="http://www.granada-learning.com">GL</a> would be up for sale soon for years now, but they've finally got round to making it official. That probably means that at least one buyer is already lined up.</p>

<p>This article claims that both <a href="http://www.espresso.co.uk">Espresso</a> (an educational multimedia company) and <a href="http://www.pearson.com/">Pearson</a> are interested. I'm surprised that Microsoft hasn't also made an offer, they've certainly been emphasising the school IT market recently, and aren't short of cash.</p>

<p>(Espresso's stuff looks wonderful)</p>
