I bought this album when it first appeared, on vinyl. I've not played it for years since I sold my hifi while scraping together enough cash to move house but recently noticed it on CD at Amazon, and realised that buying the CD was easier than buying a new amp.

The CD includes a few extra track, including Let Yourself Go which I bought after hearing it on John Peel's show back in my sixth form days, and absolutely loved. Hearing it all again almost two decades later I'm struck by just how bloody good it all is.
