<p>It's very good. Not perfect, but it's taken me (an expert grumbler)  hours to think up any complaints, and they aren't very good complaints. It deviates from the book, which may be a good thing, and it uses Gollum and Gimli for humour, which may also be a good thing, but I'm less sure of that. Gollum is very well done.</p>
