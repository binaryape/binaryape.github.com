<p>This site was an interesting read, and led me to read other OOP design articles and start rewriting much of Hippo, which had got much too bloated. It might now do slightly <i>less</i> than before, but it does it in a neater and faster way. Ah, the product-less joys of working to your own deadlines. Unfortunately I now can't bear to see my old code. I'll probably feel the same way next year.</p>
