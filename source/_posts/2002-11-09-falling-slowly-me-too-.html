<p>Memories of falling slowly. It's probably an adjusted, partially false memory.  Maybe the brains of  young children sometime store the movement information in memories badly. I've never remembered this before reading the first item on <a href="http://www.forteantimes.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6350">this Fortean Times discussion thread</a>, and I was quite startled to remember the sensation so vividly. Weird. Or at least, I can't  <em>remember</em> ever remembering this before...   It "happened" to me too.</p>
