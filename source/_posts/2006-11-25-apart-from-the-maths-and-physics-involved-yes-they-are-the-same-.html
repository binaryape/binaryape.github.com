Judith Davies, who has a daughter at the school, said: ‚ÄúMany people campaign against mobile phone masts near schools, but there is a great deal of ignorance about wireless computer networks. Yet they are like having a phone mast in the classroom and the transmitters are placed very close to the children.‚Äù

Scientific evidence is inconclusive, but some researchers think that children are vulnerable because of their thinner skulls and developing nervous systems.

<p>Wifi uses the same signal as baby monitors but unlike baby monitors the signal is not constant. The wifi units are also further away from users than baby monitors are from babies (I believe baby monitors are usually fixed to cots). Babies have very thin skulls. As far as I know the "Exposing Large Numbers Of Babies To 2.4Ghz Microwave Radiation" experiment puts us all in the clear so far.</p>

<p>Given the almighty faff I've been having with wireless networks recently they should go with a wired network <strong>because it's going to work</strong>.</p>

<p>If there's one thing worse than people who can't discriminate between different forms of radiation it's Netgear wifi bridges that kill TCP connections and Linux wifi drivers that have a mind of their own. :-) Unfortunately A. isn't keen on me taping cable over the walls or pulling up the new flat's floor yet, and she has a point.</p>
