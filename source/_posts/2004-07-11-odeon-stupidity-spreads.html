<p>Dear Odeon,</p>

<p>In December 2002 I wrote a small article on my website, describing how astonishingly badly written the Odeon website was. I was unable to use your your website at all. Using most browsers, your website is simply the word "Odeon". I went to the local UCI instead.</p>

<p>In August 2003, I discovered a way to use your site: via the efforts of a good designer, Mr Somerville, someone who clearly understands how to use the web. I visited the Odeon again.</p>

<p>Now I can no longer access your information, as you have decided to threaten Mr Somerville for giving people access to your site.</p>

<p>Your marketing director appears to possess the same effectiveness as your website designers.</p>

<p>I will now be boycotting the Odeon cinemas.</p>

<p>(Is this a sort of viral-anti-marketing campaign? Or are Mac OS X and Linux users not wanted at the Odeon? "Oi! We don't want you smart-arse types in here! Clear off and take your fancy glasses and film analysis with you!"</p>
