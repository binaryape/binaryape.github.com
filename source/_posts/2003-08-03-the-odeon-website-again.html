<p>I grumbled at length about <a href="http://www.odeon.co.uk/">the awful Odeon website</a> in <a href="http://www.binary-ape.org/tracks/archives/000115.html">a blog post last year</a>. It is possibly the worst <strike>commercial</strike> website I have ever seen.</p>

<p>Now someone has built a site that wraps up the official site content, and reshapes it to make it useful! Now you can access the Odeon site on something other than Internet Explorer for Windows. The unofficial site runs faster, is clearer, easier to use - apart from the lack of online ordering, it's better in every way.</p>

<p>The Odeon should immediately pay Matthew Somerville for his effort, and then fire everyone responsible for the original site. Or lock them in a room with <a href="http://www.useit.com/">Jacob Nielsen</a> until they repent.</p>
