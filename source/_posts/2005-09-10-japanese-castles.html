<p>I love castles (it's platonic, don't worry) but I know very little about Japanese castles so I was happy to stumble on this beatiful and informative website.</p>

<p>Japanese castles seem strange to me. Compared to the castles of Europe, China, India and the Middle East, they look beautiful but fragile, more like fortified palaces than fortresses. The base of Japanese castle buildings tend to be very strong stone, but the top half is just <em>begging</em> to be burned down.</p>

<p>It's also nice to see them in colour, as I'm used to seeing them in black and white Akira Kurosawa films.</p>
