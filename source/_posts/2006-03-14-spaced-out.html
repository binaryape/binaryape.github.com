<p>I'm a fan of <a href="http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/about-spaced/whatisspaced.shtml">Spaced</a>, so I recognised the music on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu1_SJB4YLU">this video of The IO Brush, a rather nice digital paintbrush concept</a> - it's the Happy Walk music! A bit of searching, and I found it was 'S'ill Vous Plait'  by Fantastic Plastic Machine, and was taken from the 'Sushi 4004' compilation CD.</p>

<p>Amazon has 'Sushi 4004' via a 3rd party Seller for... ¬£40. This is a bit too much.</p>

<p>So I looked for a 'Spaced' compilation CD, found it, it has the track, and it's now selling for... ¬£60.</p>

<p>The market value of a Spaced music CD is ¬£60!</p>
