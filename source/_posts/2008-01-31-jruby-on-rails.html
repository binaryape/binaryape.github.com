<a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a> started off looking like a novelty project with little practical use, but in less than a year it's become a practical tool, something with definite advantages over it's more established rivals. IBM, Oracle and Sun are already using it themselves for web apps. Netbeans 6 has rather good support for Ruby built in, and much as I cringe when running Tomcat servers (from a sysadmin's perspective) from a <em>developer's</em> point of view .war files are a definite advantage.

I think JRuby is going to do very well in 2008.
