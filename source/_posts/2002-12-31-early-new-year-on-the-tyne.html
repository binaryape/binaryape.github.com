<p>We live near the Tyne, close to the coast. Every year, many of the ships on the river sound their horns as their native New Year occurs. I like it. I'm not really enthused about New Year, but I like the idea of a wave of New Years sweeping across the timezones towards, and past, whereever I am.</p>
