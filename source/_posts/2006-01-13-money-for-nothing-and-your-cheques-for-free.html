<p>Apparently DJs in the UK need to pay ¬£200 per year for the right to copy their own CDs onto a harddisk. This is on top of public performance licences.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter where the CDs are from, either. The money is gathered by the PPL and fairly distributed to "the artists" using magical telepathy to calculate who gets what.</p>

<p>I intend to move into this growing business of nonsensical intellectual property extortion. I will collect ¬£5.00 per year from every photographer with photos featuring buildings that are posted to sites like Flickr.</p>

<p>Architects designed those buildings, they worked hard, and they deserve the money! How dare people use their creations for free! I will of course distribute the money carefully, after taking a small amount for myself to cover administrative costs.</p>

<p>This is quite reasonable. "Rather than saying stop it, don't do it, I've actually tried to embrace what people want to do and come up with a licence to be able to do that."</p>

<p>All I need is a government to pass a law for me. Sadly this doesn't come cheap. If you are an architect and want to get the ¬£1.00 per photo that is rightfully yours, please send me large sums of money to spend sending MPs on fact-finding tours, buying MPs lunch, and providing drugs to journalists.</p>

<p>(I would never claim that the entertainment monopolies do such things, of course. Perish the thought)</p>
