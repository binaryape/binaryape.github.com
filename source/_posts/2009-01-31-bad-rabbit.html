<strong>Extreme Rabbit Alert!</strong> It appears T-Mobile UK  have classed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heavenair/3029070191/">this picture of Mr Fukusuke-pon the rabbit</a> as 'adult' and blocked me from viewing it with their USB 3G web-n-walk service. I now need to take my passport to a T Mobile shop to prove that I'm old enough to see rabbits without parental supervision.
