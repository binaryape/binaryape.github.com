<p>Has a new species of great ape been discovered? Maybe. It looks to me as if it's at most a new species of chimpanzee.</p>

<p>I'm deeply skeptical of the chimp-gorilla hybrid theory. It may or may not be physically or genetically possible, but I just can't see chimpanzees or bonobos being socially compatible with gorillas. Although bonobos will have sex with <em>anything</em>, I don't think that the notoriously chaste gorillas would put up with it.</p>

<p>(Describing chimpanzees as carnivorous is a bit extreme  - they can hunt and eat meat, but most of the diet is vegetable based, I think)</p>
