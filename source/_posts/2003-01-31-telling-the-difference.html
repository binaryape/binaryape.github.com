<p>Rogue state? I've just seen the amazing Mr. Dick Cheney say that the USA will ignore the UN, and world opinion, and international law, to do what it thinks is right.</p>

<p>WMD threat? A couple of weeks ago a US Gov. spokesman said that the US is willing to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are not actually illegal under internation law, but threatening to use them is.</p>

<p>Killing civilians?  "There will not be a safe place in Baghdad. The sheer size of this has never been seen before, never been contemplated before." Shock and Awe.</p>

<p>Chemical weapons? Depleted uranium + children - medicine = dead children.</p>

<p>Biological weapons? British and American aircraft have bombed water purification plants in Iraq in a deliberate attempt to cause disease.</p>

<p>Aiding terrorism? Who founded, funded and trained Al  Qaeda? Let's just say it wasn't Iraq.</p>
