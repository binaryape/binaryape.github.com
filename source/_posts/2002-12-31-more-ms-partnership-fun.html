<p>MS are accused of exploiting a  'partner' company again. The irony is that at a press conference to annouce the partnership, <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=6905">a journalist</a> asked Sendo if they were worried that MS  might just take their information and then dump them, Sendo's spokesman said there was no possibility of that.</p>

<p>Now they say "Microsoft gained Sendo's trust and confidence through false promises".</p>
