<p>Remember the dramatic moment as crowds pulled down Saddam's statue and rejoiced? That big photogenic moment of popular uprising that the Coalition leaders had been longing for?</p>

<p><a href='http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article2842.htm'>Well, maybe it didn't happen quite like that</a>. This article claims that the crowd was small and mainly made up of coalition allied militia. I'm not sure about this claim, but given the long list of lies I've heard from the Coalition so far, I'm strongly tempted to believe it.</p>
