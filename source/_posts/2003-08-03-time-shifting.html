<p>And lo, his blog was an empty wasteland, for he had posted naught for many days!</p>

<p>Lots to do, but also lots done. No Hippo programing for two weeks as I do other things. I'm at a point where I should upload the first bugged and basic pile of code to Sourceforge's CVS, and start using makefiles and things to make progress more efficient.</p>

<p>Some days recently I've just wanted to sleep all day and night as there's so much to do, and other days I don't want to sleep at all for the same reason.</p>

<p>Time to clear some of the blog backlog (backblog?) and then wander off to see what else I can do. What I'd <i>like</i> to be doing is sitting in a quiet forest somewhere, eating cake. No chance of silvan bliss for a long time yet.</p>
