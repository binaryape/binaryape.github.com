<p>The <a href="http://www.icons.org.uk/">Icons of England</a> website has used my photo of Manchester's Vimto statue. I feel like a proper photographer now.</p>

<p>Go there now and vote for Vimto and many other things, including bubble and squeak, Marmite,  tea, mushy peas or even the Argos catalogue.</p>
