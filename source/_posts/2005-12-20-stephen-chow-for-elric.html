<p>A film of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorcock">Moorcock</a>'s Elric is rumoured to be in the early stages of production (development hell, more likely). And that means the old casting chestnut returns.</p>

<p>I agree with this poster to the Moorcock forum: Stephen Chow as Elric would be an excellent choice. But I doubt it will happen.</p>

<p>It's going to be difficult to make a <b>good</b> film based on Moorcock's Eternal Champion books, and Elric is probably the most difficult MM character to portray. I've got a horrible feeling that this might go the way of the Judge Dredd film, rather than Lord Of The Rings...</p>
