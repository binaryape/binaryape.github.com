<p>Ecstacy has reached New Jersey, and local drugs expert Terrence P. Farley explains the horrors that will destroy the area's children.  It's both scary and funny that people can believe such nonsense. It reads as if he's quoting The Onion. Articles like this undermine all the real efforts to educate people about drug effects.</p>

A few quick searches with Google show that the only person in the world using phrases like  "disco dumping" is, er, Terrence P. Farley.</p>
