<p>I've found an online shop selling a CD-ROM for ¬£49. That's not really interesting, in itself. It's also the first CD-ROM I worked on (I think I wrote two articles), which is (to me) slightly interesting.</p>

<p>But what's really interesting is that it was released <em>almost ten years ago</em> at (I think) about ¬£79, and yet there it is, in a restyled box, for ¬£49. A number of other discs of the same era are also available at rather solid prices.</p>

<p>In an industry where a ¬£10,000 graphics package will end up on eBay for ¬£50 after about three years, that's pretty good going. Maybe quality educational material is always good value, no matter how technically ancient.</p>
