<p>If you want something more powerful than Bash or Tcsh for your shell, try <a href="http://zsh.sunsite.dk/">Zsh</a>. It's got more nice features than you can shake a stick at. There's also a useful quick <a href="http://www.jamtli.no/zsh.html">guide to customising your zsh</a>. Fun? Well, it can certainly make things quicker and easier.</p>
