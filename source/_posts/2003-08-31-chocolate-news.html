<p>A few days ago I was reading a chocolate bar wrapper (as you do) and noticed that there's quite of lot of protein in chocolate: usually about 8g per 100g. In fact, there's a lot of protein in almost everything - Weetabix cereal has about 10g compared to about 12g in chicken. Not "complete" protein of course, but your body will do the mixing for you; just eat a varied diet. Nothing to worry about. Our cocoa powder tin claims about 22% protein, which is rather a lot.</p>

<p>In other chocolate news, dairy-free chocolate <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3185363.stm">is full of lovely healthy anti-oxidants</a>. Add milk though, and the effect vanishes.</p>

<p>If you now fancy some choc, <a href="http://www.greenandblacks.com/html/home.php">eat Green And Black's chocolate</a> I think it's the best there is, for you, the farmers and the environment.</p>
