We visited <a href="http://greenchorlton.org.uk/index.php">Chorlton's Big Green Festival</a> for a few hours, and it was good fun, interesting and useful. Also much bigger than we expected - there was quite a crowd too by the time I left.

I came home with a free power saving gadget, lots of leaflets and a feeling that I'm not particularly good at photographing events... I hope it continues and grows more each year.

The photo of is of the impressive vegan cupcake stall from the lovely people in <a href="http://www.manchester.vegangroup.co.uk/index.html">Manchester Vegan Society</a>. All the cakes were made by volunteers in the group.
