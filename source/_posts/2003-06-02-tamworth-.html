<p>Something Interesting Happens In Tamworth Shock!</p>

<p>"I will never forget that terrible stare. I immediately thought, 'That's not right'"</p>

<p>"I would not want any of my friends to be treated like those Iraqis on the photographs. We are a great nation. But we would lose our self-respect and much more besides if we allowed ourselves and our troops to stoop this low."</p>

<p>Well done Kelly Tilford.</p>

<p>The key issue is not so much whether or not people commit crimes, it's what happens next - whitewash, denial, or honest investigation. Some civilians are criminals, some soldiers are criminals, and the state can't really stop that. The role of the state is to deal with the problem well, and I hope that happens here.</p>
