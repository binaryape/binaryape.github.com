We've been away on a short holiday in the Lake District, with the aim of getting some fresh air and exercise, and some photography practise too if the weather was good.
</p><p>
The first evening at the hotel we witnessed a fantastic sunset. I've not seen rays radiating from a sunset before - very beautiful, and it resembled photos of the aurora borealis. They were slowly moving as we watched. Crepuscular rays?

Another guest at our hotel took <a href="http://www.ephotozine.com/u31353/gallery/819824">an excellent photo of the same sunset from Castlerigg Stone Circle</a>.
