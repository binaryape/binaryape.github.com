<p>A great example of what's possible with cascading style sheets (CSS).</p>

<p>Click on the "Select a design" links and see the style change.</p>

<p>I'm still in the angry and opinionated CSS Revolutionary Brigade: good web page creation should involve minimal Flash, minimal graphics, tables for tables and not for layout, pure valid xHTML for content, multiple CSS for decoration, and lots of RDF metadata. Big sites should generate dynamic HTML based on clearly separated content. GIFs should be replaced with PNGs. Sites should degrade to work with  text-only browsers and screen-readers. URLs should be "cool" and well designed.</p>

<p>Phew.</p>

<p>Of course, I don't actually manage to <em>do</em> most of this. :-)</p>
