<p>Since someone was either trolling or honestly offended by the item I wrote a couple of years ago about me realising my own growing snobbishness "It's Grim Up North (Shields)", I've removed it. I've got nothing against goths or large men with tattoos. (I do have something against cinema websites with incorrect information though).  I just can't be bothered responding anymore. The title of the item referred to a cartoon strip in Private Eye, the target of the item's criticism was <i>me</i>, written when I'd been having a bad time.</p>
