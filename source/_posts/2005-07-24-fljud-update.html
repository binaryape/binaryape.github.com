<p>At long last Fljud 0.5 can do at least as much as Fljud 0.4! The "three month" rewrite has now taken a year and frankly I'm looking forward to getting back to something web related for a while as a sort of holiday from messing about with XMPP/Jabber.</p>

<p>First I need to tidy up some of the mess, add a few missing bits, and release the beta, sometime in the middle of August if all goes well. Then the beta can sit around revealing obscure bugs while I fix them, and a final release of 0.5 should occur in mid September.</p>

<p>Get it while it's 'ot: <a href="http://jabberstudio.org/projects/fljud/releases/view.php?id=778">File Details: fljud-0.5alpha2.1.tgz - JabberStudio</a></p>
