<p>We've moved, but 99.9% of our possessions haven't: the lift at our new address isn't working, and (rather understandably) the removal company can't carry our things up 12 flights of stairs.</p>

<p>So right now we're in Week 3 of living in an almost empty flat. It's a strange experience, and hopefully it will be over soon. Sorry if you've sent us emails recently we will get round to answering them eventually. Hopefully.</p>

<p>Yes, it has been raining.</p>
