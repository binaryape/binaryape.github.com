<p>It's quite clear that there is extensive looting going on in Iraq, gang warfare, murder, rape, vandalism. There is overwhelming evidence from free media reporters all over Iraq, video evidence, interviews with staff at hospitals and universities. Universities, hospitals and museums are being destroyed.  Iraq as a nation state is being destroyed.</p>

<p>And yet the coalition forces have so far done three significant things:</p>

<p>1) Guard the oil. Guard the oil offices.
2) Deny there is a problem.
3) Threaten the press</p>
