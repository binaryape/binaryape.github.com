<p>Photos and videos of (clothed) women <a href="http://www.geschaeftskontakte2000.de/rundundbund/Foto1.htm">blowing up balloons</a>, and sometimes popping them. Very odd, but as strange sexual fetishes go, it looks pretty harmless. And also completely unerotic.</p>

<p>I found this while looking for airship information. I'm a fan of airships, but not, I repeat <b>not</b> in this way. I wonder what balloon-o-sexuals think of airships?</p>
