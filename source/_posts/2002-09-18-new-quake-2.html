<p>Quake 2 may be old, but it's still played <a href="http://spen.tv">by</a> <a href="http://www.pixelpeeps.com/">many</a> <a href="http://www.binaryjunk.com">people</a>. <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com">Id Software</a> kindly <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open sourced</a> the code last year, and here's the result: a new version of Quake 2 with many bugfixes and new features, and more to come.</p>

<pre><code>    I could never get past The Big Gun without Q2  crashing. Now I can get back to the game, and with full OpenGL acceleration under Linux too.  &lt;a href="http://quakeforge.net/"&gt;QuakeForge&lt;/a&gt; also have an enhanced version of the original Quake.
