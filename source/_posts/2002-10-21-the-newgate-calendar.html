<p>"The Newgate Calendar was one of those books, along with a Bible, Foxe's book of Martyrs and the Pilgrim's Progress, most likely to be found in any English home between 1750 and 1850." A strange, influential and almost forgotten book describing some of those executed in Newgate Prison. One of the books in <a href="http://www.exclassics.org/index.html">Ex-Classics</a>.</p>
