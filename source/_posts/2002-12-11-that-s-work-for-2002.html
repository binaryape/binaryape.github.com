<p>That's it for work this year. For the last few years I've been Last Person In The Office as my coworkers go off to the pub, and I wander around the empty office for a couple of hours, staring at servers and worrying. This year I'm spending my unused holiday days on an early departure and the guilt-free intention to have absolutely nothing to do with the network until 2003.</p>

<p>This might be my last time off work for a while. I'm considering saving my holidays next year so I can trade them in for cash when I migrate south. At the very least I'll need to spend them carefully.</p>

<p>Side effect: my brain is convinced that today is Friday. I've almost wandered off to watch 'The Osbournes' on TV and wondered why <a href="http://www.ntk.net">NTK</a> hasn't arrived. Doh.</p>
