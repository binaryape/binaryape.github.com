<p>We went to see <a href="http://www.kungfuhustle.co.uk/">Kung Fu Hustle</a> this morning, and it was good. Stupid, shallow, but great fun, and very funny. We went to the day's first showing and there were only about a dozen people in the audience, but it still got one of the best audience reactions I've seen - everyone was laughing every few minutes. A couple of scenes are strangely moving too.</p>

<p>I had to narrate the subtitles to A. while the snakes were on screen and she shut her eyes.</p>
