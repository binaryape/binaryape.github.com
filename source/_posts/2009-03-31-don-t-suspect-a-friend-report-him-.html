Why would a suicide bomber or car bomber bother to check where CCTV cameras are? They're almost everywhere. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hbl/3388966957/sizes/l/">What difference would they make?</a>

Another poster in this series encourages people to report neighbours who have "chemicals" in their bins. Presumably hobbyist dyers, film developers, etchers, etc will now be suspects.

This poster campaign is negative, dangerous scare mongering.

There are some good <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/03/26/remixes-of-the-paran.html">satirical spoofs of the posters</a> at BoingBoing, and here's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ddtv/">someone likely to get reported in Manchester</a>, right there on Flickr.
