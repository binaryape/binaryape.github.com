<p>US Senator Hollings' proposed CBDTPA law would make any new "digital media device" illegal in the US unless it included government approved copy protection. It seems that the ability to move data around without permission from the authorities is a terrible threat to the world. The whole idea is both idiotic and very scary. Scary because a supposedly sane person is proposing the death of IT freedom in the US to boost his sponsor's (Disney) profits, and idiotic because the law itself is utterly unworkable and would cost the USA billions. Each day, the <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/">Freedom To Tinker</a> site is listing an item that would get CBDTPA regulation.</p>
