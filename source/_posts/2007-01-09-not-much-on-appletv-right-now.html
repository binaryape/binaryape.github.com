<p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">AppleTV</a> gadget looks neat and has a good price but a closed product tied to one supplier of content isn't going to tempt many people until it has some actual content. The UK iTunes store currently offers 0 TV shows and 0 movies.</p>

<p>I can buy* "Tin Toy" and a few other Pixar shorts for ¬£1.89 each, but so far that's it.</p>

<p>Of course, if the AppleTV box can run MythTV I'll be queueing up to get one. It's good value at ¬£200 just as a remote iTunes node, even without the video features.</p>

<p>(*Buying DRMed products isn't really buying in the traditional sense, of course. You just borrow them from Apple)</p>
