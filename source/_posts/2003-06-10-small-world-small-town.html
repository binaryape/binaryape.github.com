<p>The Idler is putting together a book about <a href="http://www.idler.co.uk/html/frontsection/craptown/craptown16.htm">crap British towns</a>. Metafilter (I wish I could post, it's a good site) has <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/26300">a discussion on the topic</a>.</p>

<p>Quite a few people dislike Coventry*, which is understandable, but Nuneaton is mentioned twice, and then Atherstone! I'm a little startled that someone in the somewhat exclusive Metafilter site mentioned Atherstone - it's a town smaller than the nearby village I grew up in:</p>

<p>"Also not mentioned, and less exciting even than Nuneaton, is Atherstone, an intensely uninteresting yet mildly spooky backwater where I once spent the better, or should I say longer part of a year."</p>

<p>That would be it. I was once chased by an Atherstonian primary-school-aged child wielding a knife (I was 19), but that was in the 'bad' part of town (two or three streets). There are some very nice people there, and a real community, but there's definitely something odd about the place.</p>

<p>*In Coventry's defense, it was extensively bombed during WWII and then rebuilt by idiots. It still isn't as grim as Gateshead city centre.</p>
