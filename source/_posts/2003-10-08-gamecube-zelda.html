<p><a href="http://www.zelda.com/gcn/index.jsp">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a> is simply the most wonderful video game I've ever played. It's near perfect. I don't even like this type of game, normally. I can enjoy <em>not</em> playing it too - just wandering around, sailing or watching the storms.</p>

<p>Sony and Microsoft promote their consoles as powerful, cool, sexy, but I think Nintendo has the best attitude: consoles are toys. They should be fun.</p>
