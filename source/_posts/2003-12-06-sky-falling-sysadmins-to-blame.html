<p>Ironic timing for <a href="http://www.softwarereality.com/lifecycle/role_fragmentation.jsp">this article, via Slashdot</a>...</p>

<p>The author believes that a plague of systems adminstators is crippling business, and software development in particular. I've seen this happen (from a distance) so I can't deny it, but I've also seen it go the other way too - in my opinion the greatest threat to an organisation's data security is a project manager with a deadline: "Just open the firewall for it!"</p>

<p>The article is a mix of reasonable points badly presented, and plain whining, but the comments following it address that just fine, so I won't bother. I did find this part particularly spot-on, though:</p>

<p><cite>Firstly, the true cost of administration must be accounted for when totalling up the cost of any project. Administration dead-time is a significant and growing aspect of all projects I have witnessed in the past 5 years. Dead-time waiting for software to arrive, files to be undeleted, versions to be mandated: it all needs to be added up and made explicit.</cite></p>

<p>The curse of systems administration is that only the bad sysadmins and the absent sysadmins are visible. A good sysadmin fades into the background, sadly.</p>

<p>(Article starts with an unpleasant picture of an unfortunate donkey)</p>
