<p>I'm enjoying Timo Maas' new album 'Pictures', but the title track is a little too experimental. 'Pictures' has a good tune but the lyrics are simply <em>disturbing</em>: the spooky, threatening and pleading words of a paedophile with a camera talking to a boy. The music is enjoyable and the words are repellent, which makes it stronger as a work of art (and quite a brave thing to do - would this get on Radio 1?) but more difficult to listen to.</p>

<p>Also, ending a sentence with "... boy..." in a southern USA drawl can make practically anything sound sinister.</p>
