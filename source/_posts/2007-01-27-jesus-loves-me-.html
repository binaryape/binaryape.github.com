<p>Today someone outside the library told me "Jesus loves you!". Honestly, Jesus is like a shy teenager sending a friend to be a go-between. I'm going to need more active persuasion than that.</p>

<p>I responded with something like "Thanks, that's nice. But I'm not that keen on him". That sounded a bit patronising, and I didn't mean it to. Frankly I'd rather it sounded a bit funnier and slightly ruder. This is OK: evangelic Christians like a bit of mild persecution. It makes them feel like they're doing their jobs properly. Nobody got to be a saint as a result of polite "no-thank-yous".</p>

<p>As I'm too dim to manage an instant and witty response I'm working on better replies so that next time I can appear mildly persecutional and destined for their hell. So far I've got:</p>

<ul>
<li>"But he never phones!"</li>
<li>"Yeah, but he never stays the night" &lt;-- I think the gay element might improve things</li>
<li>"I'd like to talk, but Cthulhu will rip me apart if I talk to you. He's waking up, you know."</li>
<li>"Krishna sent me a birthday card - what did Jesus send? Nothing."</li>
<li>"I like monkeys. I've heard that The Bible doesn't have any monkeys in it at all"</li>
<li>"The Bible says that Pi equals 3."</li>
</ul>

<p>There's a slim chance the poor deluded fool will wake up one day and realise he's wasting his only life worrying about the one he'll never have, but sadly I don't think snarky comments about Elder Gods will be enough.</p>

<p>A. assures me that she never gets approached by Evangelicals, but this was the second one I've been approached by this week. I think my hat is attracting them.</p>
