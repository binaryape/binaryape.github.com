<p>Buddhists are pretty laid back about their symbols. I'm certainly not offended by things like this <a href="http://www.divine-interventions.com/buddha.html">Buddha dildo</a>, it's rather amusing, and a lot less rude than some of the things I saw in a shop window in Norway recently.</p>

<p>However, the <a href="http://www.divine-interventions.com/baby.html">"Baby Jesus Butt Plug"</a> is much funnier, even if I don't quite understand what the point is.</p>

<p>This post really deserves to be on <a href="http://www.binary-ape.org/samwise/">Samwise</a>.</p>
