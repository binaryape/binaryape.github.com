<p>It's a standard plot element of Chinese/Hong Kong cinema: send a lone policeman to sort out a big problem far away. Probably <a href="http://www.jackie-chan.com/">Jackie Chan</a>, <a href="http://www.jetli.com/">Jet Li</a> or <a href="http://www.sammohung.com/index1.htm">Sammo Hung</a>. Improbable, but fun.</p>

<p>But in real life, when the UN requests help from China (problems in Afghanistan), China sends... one policeman!</p>

<p>"Zhang Ming, a policeman with experience fighting drug trafficking in Hainan Province, south China, will leave for Afghanistan on January 16 on a UN peacekeeping mission."</p>

<p>He's probably an intelligence advisor rather than an action hero type, but wait for the 'true story' film.</p>
