I've started to include the words "as it were" when talking, far more than I should, and often for no apparent reason. By saying this when there's no apparent metaphor I'm making some sentences vaguer and other seem like baffling innuendo. I don't know where I've picked this up from (my vocabulary is easily influenced) but the phrase is already irritating <em>me</em>, never-mind any unfortunate people trapped nearby.
