<p>In <a href="http://www.ds2.pg.gda.pl/~colan/screenplay.htm">'The Matrix'</a>, Thomas Anderson has a short and neat, if rather cliched online name. Which was fortunate.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson? That is the sound of inevitability. That is the sound of your death. Goodbye, Mr. Anderson."</p>

<p>"My... name... is... <a href="http://perceptionss.diaryland.com/030131_60.html">chunkylover53</a>!"</p>

<p>I really enjoyed The Matrix. I can forgive its vast, gaping plot holes. While I'm looking forward to seeing the next one, I really hope the sequel isn't just a remix of the original. Watching the <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/">recent trailer</a>, one scene looked a little too much like the original's  foyer fight. Also, Neo's new outfit reminds me of Father Ted.</p>
