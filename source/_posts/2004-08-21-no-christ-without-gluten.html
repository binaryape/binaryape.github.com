<p>If this story is true (and it's <i>almost</i> too weird to be true), then wheat is required to get into heaven. Rice won't do.</p>

<p>Surely if the wafer <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=transubstantiate">transubstantiates</a>, then the girl would be OK? She doesn't claim to be Body Of Christ intolerant, just wheat intolerant. Or does the transubstantiation occur later in the digestive process?</p>
