<p>This is a great idea: In Poland new books are advertised with dramatic trailers, as if they were films. Neil Gaiman's excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0755305078/qid=1141492775/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-6570647-9177437">"Anansi Boys"</a> has been translated into Polish, and now has it's own Polishized* trailer. I was a little puzzled by the white Anglo-Caribean characters, until A. pointed out the probable lack of suitable actors in Poland, not known for it's Jamaican community.</p>
