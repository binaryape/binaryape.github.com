<p>Somehow most reports on the new Apple stuff missed this: an Apple X11 package for Mac OS X, with integrated Aqua window manager, Dock compatibility and Quartz Extreme Open GL acceleration for all windows, not just 3D apps. Good Apple.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Apple's new "Airport Extreme" 54mb wifi cards will not fit into iBooks. They're smaller, but a completely different card type. Bad Apple, bad.</p>
