<p>Making the best of Pratchett reading with a map. You'll still not get all the cross references until you read the books a second time, though. It's interesting to see that some of the groups can be read from starter books at each end.</p>

<p>I'd like to see someone do this for Michael Moorcock novels. There are some quite remarkable parallel plots and "crossover" chapters in some of the classic Moorcock novels.</p>

<p>This diagram resembles a small MUD map, which is pleasantly appropriate.</p>
