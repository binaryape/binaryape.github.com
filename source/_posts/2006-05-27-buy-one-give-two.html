<p>A worthwhile pledge at PledgeBank:</p>

<blockquote>
Nicholas Negroponte has previewed of the $100 laptop that he has designed for students in the developing world. " One Laptop Per Child - a Preview of the Hundred Dollar Laptop http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/00... "

The suggestion has been made that he also offer it for sale for ~$300 to the rest of us so that we do have an interesting machine and can help to support the cost computers for the developing world. If he does offer it, then I will buy one at three times the cost and thus contribute to supplying two to the proposed users.
</blockquote>

<p>I was hoping this would be possible so to make it more likely I've signed up.</p>
