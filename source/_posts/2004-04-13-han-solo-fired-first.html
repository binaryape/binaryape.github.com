<p>We were hoping that George Lucas would release the original Star Wars films on DVD (maybe in a special-special edition, maybe as part of the DVD menu, maybe just in a separate box).</p>

<p>But no - he won't sell his "rough cuts" again, so the DVD is Special Edition versions only. Rather then keep my VCR for the sake of my three remaining video tapes, I think I'll copy them on to DVD or harddisk, keep the tapes and sell the VCR.</p>
