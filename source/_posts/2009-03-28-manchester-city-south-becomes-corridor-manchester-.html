While reading <a href="http://www.manchesterconfidential.com/index.asp?sessionx=IpqiNwB6JDbjKaqiNwF6IHqi">Sir Richard Leese does a Big Fat Pipe</a> on Manchester Confidential I thought to myself "This Manchester Corridor project reminds me of Manchester City South..." In fact, it's got <a href="http://www.corridormanchester.com/index.php">almost the same website</a>: it looks as if the Manchester City South project has been rebranded.
</p><p>
Rather spookily I wrote <a href="http://apetracks.binary-ape.org/2008/03/a-new-oxford-ro.html">a rare blog post</a> on Manchester City South last year and said
</p><blockquote>
"Calling it "City South": A bad idea. [...] so I'll suggest calling it 'The Corridor', since people already talk of 'The Oxford Road Corridor' (and it sounds academic)"
</blockquote><p>
Thanks!

Leese's Big Fat Pipe is a plan for 100MB 'broadband' to be made available to flats and offices down Oxford Road. Since most places on Oxford Road are either already on Janet (much faster) or are a takeaway,  I'm not sure how much of an impact this will have (it would be better in the web-startup-filled Northern Quarter) but decent Internet access is <strong>not to be sniffed at</strong>, wherever it is. Speed is actually less of an issue than symmetric  bandwidth: we need better upload speeds than ADSL can provide.

More please!
