<p><a href="http://www.plattfields.org/index.htm">The Friends of Platt Fields</a> have produced a new and rather good <a href="http://www.plattfields.org/index.htm">website</a> of information <a href="http://www.plattfields.org/platt.htm">about the park</a>. Although many old features of the park have been lost (I miss the little zoo) it seems to be having something of a renaissance, with lots of improvements and community activities going on. Manchester doesn't have enough open spaces and Platt Fields is a very welcome expanse of <strong>green</strong> in an otherwise brown and grey city.</p>

<p>We enjoyed the Diwali festival that was held at Platt Fields last year, and I'm rather pleased that <a href="http://www.plattfields.org/event40.htm">some of my photos have been used in the new site</a> (they are all Creative Commons licensed).</p>
