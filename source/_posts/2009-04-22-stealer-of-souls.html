Another couple of cases of Police officers applying laws that don't actually exist:
</p><blockquote>
“The officer was talking to me and said I don't care if you're a professional photographer or not you can't take a picture of a child without written consent of the parent.”
</blockquote><p>
(The child in this case was allegedly vandalising a tree)
