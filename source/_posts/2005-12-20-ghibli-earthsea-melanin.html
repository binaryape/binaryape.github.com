<p>Studio Ghibli are producing an animated film based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthsea">'Wizard of Earthsea'</a> novels. This is good.</p>

<p>Small rant: Ghibli have never made a bad film and the artwork looks great, but it's disappointing that once again, Earthsea's inhabitants have been given the wrong skin colour. Ged's skin is red-brown in colour. It's a shame that one of the few 'classic' fantasy works with non-caucasian characters is usually illustrated with images of white people.</p>
