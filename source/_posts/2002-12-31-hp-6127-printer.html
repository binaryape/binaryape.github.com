<p>We needed a new printer - our (at least five year old) Canon BJC-610 was not at all happy working with Mac OS X via Linux. As Arteth needs to print stuff for her course, and she works on a Mac, we decided to upgrade.</p>

<p>I originally chose and ordered an HP 995c, an unusual printer with Bluetooth networking and a duplex unit built in. It  was recently discontinued, and I couldn't get hold of one without waiting until February, so after some very last minute research I ordered an <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/un/WF05/18972-236251-236261-14438-83026.html">HP 6127</a> instead.</p>

<p>This seems to be the official replacement for the HP 995c - it has a similar spec, but most importantly, it's got better features, it looks nicer, and it's cheaper. It also arrived the next morning, despite me ordering at 4.30pm in late December.  Thanks <a href="http://www.simply.co.uk">Simply Computers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Key features</strong>
- Nice print quality. Aimed more at office use (charts etc) than photos.
- Very, very easy to set up and use.
- Not a bad speed, but pretty quiet.
- A duplexer. It can print on both sides of each sheet paper, if you want.
- It has excellent drivers for all almost all operating systems. Mac OS X, Linux, Unix, etc.
- No Bluetooth, but instead it has full 10/100 ethernet and a web-based user interface built in. This is very nice.</p>

<p>At work I last year I  ordered some networkable printers from Epson. This HP has much better features for half the price.</p>

<p>On my experience so far, I thoroughly recommend it as a home network or small office printer.</p>
