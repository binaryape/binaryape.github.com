<p>This is an interesting survey, but rather flawed in places: It sometimes assumes that people feel a particular way about a country, in a simple, nationalistic sense, but I think most people are more subtle than that.</p>

<p>Attitudes to the USA are often the most complex, and very difficult to push into a simple of answer of 'favourable' or 'unfavourable'. Who or what is being judged - living conditions, foreign policy, culture? A lot of people will consider the USA's foriegn policy to be obscene but quite like the place, and it's people. The question assumes a simplistic prejudice, that people think in terms a "country" as one homogenous unit, and as a result, it gives an answer that presents a prejudice that probably isn't there.</p>

<p>I read an interview somewhere (possibly a book extract) with a leading Jihadi terrorist, who was dedicated to the overthrow of the US but who loved US food, TV and music, and quite fancied living there one day.</p>

<p>The report gets better when it moves on and asks more precise questions, about 'national characteristics' (still somewhat dodgy...)</p>

<blockquote>"Americans generally rate themselves better than does the rest of the world, but there are a couple of exceptions. Strikingly, Americans are more inclined than any other public in this survey to say their fellow Americans are greedy."</blockquote>

<p>and, of course, foreign policy.</p>

<p>The 'Bad Vibes in the Neighbourhood' section is interesting, and 'Where to go to lead a good life" is very interesting indeed: Canada and Australia do best, and even the UK pops up as #1 choice in Poland (?) and Spain (where many British people want to live). I do wonder what the full results were for this question, as the leading choices have rather low percentages.</p>

<p>Most significant, I think, is 'Better if another rivalled US Power?': it seems most people surveyed want another <b>military</b> superpower to keep the USA in check. I'd quite like a socio-economic superpower (more than one, preferably) to balance US influence, but the question sounds a like "Do you want a cold war again?", and returned a worrying answer.</p>
