The flash-lit fog over the cobbles in this photo reminds me of a painting or pencil sketch I've seen <em>somewhere</em>, but I can't find it. Maybe the image resembles a faded century-old photo. I like the effect.

I'm in the photo taking <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/binaryape/2135625458/">a picture of The Palace Hotel's sign glowing in the gloom</a>.

Arteth's mention of Vallette led me to <a href="http://www.manchestergalleries.org/the-collections/search-the-collection/mcgweb/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=469">his painting of Albert Square</a> and <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~anthony.seaton/LANCASHIRESCENE1925.JPG">this drawing by Lowry</a>.

(Trivia: The <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-gb&q=white+dog+poo+life+on+mars&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">white dog poo interrogation</a> scene in 'Life on Mars' took place just to the left of the picture.)
