While migrating over to Typepad I noticed that I've posted about 500 items to Apetracks since it started in 2002, but I've also started, but never posted, <strong>over 700</strong> other items. If you think what I've posted is bad, you should see some of the stuff I never got round to finishing.
</p><p>
I did the sensible thing and deleted them all.

I also deleted a pile of recent, relatively decent drafts that would have been posted to the old Apetracks, had it not been playing up a bit. That wasn't quite so sensible.
