<p>I don't drink tea or coffee but I'm known for eating a fair bit of <a href="http://www.greenandblacks.com/">Green and Blacks</a> chocolate. I <strong>like</strong>  chocolate.</p>

<p>We've recently tried three new medium-sized bars of chocolate by Organica. All are high quality Swiss dark chocolate, organic, ethically sourced, fully vegan, and <a href="http://wirelessdigest.typepad.com/hippyshopper/2005/05/green_blacks_go.html">not owned by Cadburys</a>. The 'Tangiers' bar is orangey, similar to Green and Black's classic 'Maya Gold', but with orange peel and a tangier taste. Nice, but not too exciting. The 'Marrakesh' bar has lots of cinnamon, nutmeg and small raisins and triggered some nostalgia for Midwestern desserts*. Pleasant, warm, Christmasy taste.</p>

<p>The third bar is called 'Food of the Gods', rather appropriately**. Imagine a dark chocolate bar full of crunchy, brittle nuts. Nuts that are actually raw cocoa nibs (the centre of a cocoa bean). This is a really good bar of chocolate if you like real chocolate. This chocolate bar is not elaborate or subtle or delicate (try <a href="http://www.boojabooja.com/products.htm">Booja Booja</a> for that), it's <em>hardcore</em>. If you prefer chocolate that's mainly milk and sugar and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_and_slavery">produced by child slaves</a> then avoid this bar. This is the <strong>good stuff</strong>. Recommended.</p>

<p>I'll post more chocolate reviews and photos soon, as I've been invited to take photos at a vegan chocolate tasting event next weekend. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abIJ2MPtWOk">Mmmm.</a>..</p>

<p>I can't find Organica on the web but there's a <a href="http://www.confectionerynews.com/news/ng.asp?n=74546-organica-fairtrade-organic-vegan">news item on the new bars at Confectionary News.</a>  I bought mine at <a href="http://www.eighth-day.co.uk/">8th Day</a>.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20pt;">* As an English person I'm always struck by how the Midwestern USA seems covered in a cloud of cinnamon/nutmeg spice mix. Airports, shopping malls, bookshops, streets, cars, restaurants, homes. It's nice. England probably smells of last-night's spilled lager and urine to visiting Midwesterners.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20pt;"> ** The chocolate plant's latin name means "food of the gods". <span style="font-size:12pt;">
