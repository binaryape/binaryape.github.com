<p>An 'about' page for Pete Birkinshaw. You can see my main OpenID identity and linked resources at <a href="http://claimid.com/binaryape">ClaimID</a>.</p>

<h2>The Man...</h2>

<p>I live in Manchester and work as a senior sysadmin and developer for a large university in the UK. I'm specialising in middleware and web development and prefer working with UNIX, LDAP, XML, Perl and Ruby.</p>

<p>After staring at a computer display all day I like to go home and stare at a computer display for a while longer, as maintaining a healthy work/home balance is important.</p>

<p>Sometimes I go outside and take photographs, with a strong emphasis on quantity over quality. I have most of the hobbies you would expect someone like me to have, plus a few you wouldn't.</p>

<h2>The Legend...</h2>

<p>I tend to use the online monikers "BinaryApe" or "Binape", and use the <a href="http://binary-ape.org">binary-ape.org</a> domain as my own scruffy corner of the Internet. I've been Slashdotted, very briefly mentioned in The Guardian, cited in a letter to Congress by Ralph Nader, and yet I've still done very little of interest.</p>

<h2>Things That I Sometimes Do</h2>

<p>Here are a few personal projects I work on. Please bear in mind that I'm an enthusiast/hacker type rather than a proper software engineer, despite sometimes being mistaken for one.</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="http://fljud.jabberstudio.org">FLJUD</a>  - A Jabber user directory based around LDAP.  It's used by a number of universities and businesses around the world as an online addressbook.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://binary-ape.org/baxl/wiki/index.php?title=BAXL">BAXL</a>  - A framework for quickly assembling Jabber components. Used by Fljud, and I've got many plans for this once it's more stable.</li>
    <li> Tehuti A new way to share files within an organisation, based on Ruby on Rails. This is actually under active development at the moment but no files are available.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://hippodev.sourceforge.net">Hippo</a>  - A rather large project intended to produce a novel content management system with a focus on metadata and microcontent. Very much on the backburner at the moment while I work on FLJUD and BAXL. It will probably never be finished, or useful.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://binaryape.sourceforge.net">Fingerbob</a>  - A Finger to LDAP gateway. Little more than an LDAP version of Hello World, but still quite useful for people wanting quick access to company addressbooks from command-line systems without LDAP tools. I plan to rewrite it in a new language at regular intervals.</li>
    <li> Writing - I specialise in unfinished, unpublished, often unseen fiction.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.binary-ape.org/apetracks/"> Ape::Tracks</a>   - Yet another personal blog, I'm afraid. Interesting links and opinionated badly written grumbles for the most part, but lacks kitten photos and stories about babies.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://lazyweb.org">LazyWeb</a>  - In the spirit of the LazyWeb, gentleman adventurer <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com">Ben Hammersley</a>  and the general public provide 100% of the content for this grand site. (Currently offline, due for re-release soon)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apes, Books, Contributions</h2>

<p>If you feel the urge to send me things:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Bug reports, suggestions, patches, angry-but-useful comments, ideas will help my software projects improve</li>
    <li>Technical books from my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/UQVD1L2M5ZP5/202-6570647-9177437">Amazon Wishlist</a> would be much appreciated, and well-used.</li>
    <li>Most of all, if any of my projects are of use to you, please consider making a small donation to <a href="http://www.dianfossey.org">The Gorilla Organisation</a> (previously known as The Diane Fossey Gorilla Fund) as there are some great apes who need your help much, much more than I do.</li>
</ul>
