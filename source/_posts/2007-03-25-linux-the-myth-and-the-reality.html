Ouch. I think <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/samh101/">Sam's</a> been a little too harsh, but <a href="http://cdn.novell.com/cached/video/bs_07/mac_pc_linux.mpg">Novell's video</a> was a bit... awkward. I like the point (there's more than just Windows vs Mac) but in an advert with a dull, inadequate Windows person and smug hipster Mac person, the Linux person should really have had a beard, worn a Think Geek shirt, and not actually said anything. Why have two stereotypes when you can have three?</div>
