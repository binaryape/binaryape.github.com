<p>My plan for the Yule break was to dedicate three days to each of my "main" projects, and try to get a new version of each ready for release. This hasn't happened. Instead I've been working 4 to 12 hours a day on Hippo.</p>

<p>It's been very educational and a lot of fun, and Hippo is now considerably bigger and better than I'd planned.  I'm now months ahead of schedule, which is nice, but thanks to 'feature-creep' I'm now not writing a simple client app. Hippo has become an unusual community 'information management' system.</p>
