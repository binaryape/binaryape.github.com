<p><a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> is a Linux distribution that frowns on binary software - everything is compiled as it is installed. This can take a while. It has a legion of vocal fans who are now making even Debian and FreeBSD users seem un-smug by comparison.</p>

<p>I've been getting less enthusiastic about Gentoo ever since I first read about it. It's a neat idea, but I haven't actually tried it yet, I admit. I haven't got round to installing Mandrake 10 yet either, for the same reason - I don't have the time. I don't have the need.</p>

<p>If I need a particular application optimised for my particular use for it, I'll compile it. Things like SleepyCat's database, or OpenLDAP. When I need to, I'll compile my own kernels.  I just don't think I'm going to be on this planet long enough to spare 10 hours watching KDE compile if I can get a set of peer tested packages installed in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Gentoo can be educational, it's a good demonstration of what open source can do. But I think a lot of its users might grow out of it, when they realise that running someone's make script isn't quite so exciting any more.</p>
