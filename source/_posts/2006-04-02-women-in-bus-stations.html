<p>While trying to find out more about this statue in Blackburn, Google led me to <a href="http://omnibusgirls.fotopic.net/">Omnibus Girls</a>, in which someone collects photos of women in bus stations, <i>especially if the woman is near a bus</i>. This is not a hobby I was previously aware of.<br />
