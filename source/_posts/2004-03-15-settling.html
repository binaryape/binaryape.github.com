<p>After a month of considerable expense, stress and frustration we've now "moved in", to somewhere smaller and less well placed than before, but somewhere we can actually get our stuff into. We went from a roomy flat with nothing in it to a 'cosy' flat stuffed with cardboard boxes. It's taken a while to sort and repack our stuff, but at last it feels like we're emerging from the mess.</p>
