<p>The BBC have launched two new TV series recently.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/robinhood/index.shtml">Robin Hood</a> - Utter rubbish. Not one redeeming feature, even the political references are heavy-handed and dull. Somehow manages to be less believable than <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/m/maidmarianandher_1299001973.shtml">Maid Marian and Her Merry Men</a>. Avoid.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/torchwood/">Torchwood</a> - Take Angel, Ultraviolet, maybe bits of Highlander, flavour with Doctor Who, and set in Cardiff. It isn't great. It somehow isn't terrible either, despite often looking as if it's actually trying to be crap. Torchwood is absolutely <em>not</em> a British 'X Files', but it might well become a British 'Angel'.</p>

<p>One episode involves a cyberman that slowly chases people around in circles, trying to grab them with its sparky-hands-of-death. Avoid that one.</p>
