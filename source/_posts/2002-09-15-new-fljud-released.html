<p>I've released a new version of <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/fljud/?topic_id=68%2C22">Fljud</a> onto <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/binary-ape/">Sourceforge</a>. This one's mainly bug fixes and a bit more documentation. I've been careful to check that lots of different browsable folder configurations are possible, but I forgot to check that users could configure only one, or even none at all. Doh. I'm leaving Fljud alone for a while now so I can work on Fljauth and Smartcast instead.</p>
