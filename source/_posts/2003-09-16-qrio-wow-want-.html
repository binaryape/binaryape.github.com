<p>People in Japan seem to really, <i>really</i> want "real" robots, and it looks as if their robots are just about ready. This new robot from Sony look absolutely astonishing. Qrio is also consumer technology, admittedly not exactly mass market yet, but available to buy, not just a research toy.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I want one. All I need now is enough money.</p>
