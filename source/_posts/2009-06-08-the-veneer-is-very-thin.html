Hmm. The BNP are declaring 'The British' to be descended from:
</p><blockquote>
"Celts, Anglo-Saxons, Danes, Norse and closely related kindred peoples"
</blockquote><p>
My first reaction was to joke that they were anti-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaker_culture">Beaker People</a>, but read that list again - no <em>Romans</em>? I'm no fan of the Roman Empire myself, but that's insane even from a nationalist perspective. No French? Are they forgetting 1066 too? There have been Jewish communities in Britain <strong>for over a thousand years</strong>, yet they aren't on the list either. Most nationalism involves a selective view of the past, but this takes the biscuit.

That list isn't about being British at all - it's another way to say "Nordic Aryan only". The BNP's bigotry isn't just pro-'white' or 'anti-black', it's simply the Nazi party's concept of "racial purity".
