<p>There are at least 15,000 people living in Manchester city centre. There are 3 NHS GPs.</p>

<p>Not to worry! David King of the Manchester Primary Healthcare Trust says: "There is only one surgery in the city centre, but there are surgeries close in Collyhurst and Rusholme where lots of people go."</p>

<p>Who told me I couldn't register. But wait: "there has been a huge rise in the numbers of people in residential accommodation in the city centre, but that does not mean that demand for GPs has risen." A population increase of 1,000 to 15,000 in a decade, but no rise in demand, that is amazing Mr King.</p>

<p>How is this possible? "Mr King also argued that many young professionals with a pad in the city were likely to have private healthcare as part of their employment package, or many were registered with a doctor close to their family home where they could return at weekends." Ah, so I should go visit Newcastle upon Tyne, or go private, I see.</p>

<p>If I sound a little miffed here it's because I've got just been told that I might have a  problem with my eyes after an eye test, and I ended up having to beg a tiny place miles away to take me - they actually said they didn't want me to register with them as they're struggling already, but the other places they suggested I go to had already refused to let me register.</p>

<p>So now I feel guilty enough to consider going private, which I can't afford, because I'm a burden on a surgery that already has enough to deal with in a poor part of Manchester without IT people clogging up their waiting room.</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems Mr King is (or has) looked into the situation to check if his bizzare statements are true, so hopefully we'll get some doctors.</p>
