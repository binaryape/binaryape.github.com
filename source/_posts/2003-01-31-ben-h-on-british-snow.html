<p>Arteth's parents phoned us at Christmas from Missouri, and mentioned that the previous night they'd <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/World584195.html">had <strong>ten inches</strong> of snow</a>. But that was it - despite a few deaths from traffic accidents, it wasn't that big a deal for most people. London recently managed to gridlock after a few flakes.  People were trapped in cars overnight. The rail network collapsed.</p>

<p>The old nationalised British Rail had snow clearing equipment and spare locomotives on standby in areas where snow could be a problem. The new, more "efficient" privatised rail service doesn't.</p>

<p>Ben Hammersley <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/archives/003970.html#003970">sums up the current amazing weather</a> of light snow and slightly freezing temperatures rather well:</p>

<p>"Minus 2! Minus 2! Minus 2c and the country shuts down? For fucks sake, people. Grit the roads, and put on another jumper. "</p>
