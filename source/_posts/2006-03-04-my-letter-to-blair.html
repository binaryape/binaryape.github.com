<p>Well, <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Email_The_PM_Form.asp">an online form</a> to a junior Labour Party wonk really.</p>

<blockquote>
I would be grateful if you could confirm which particular god is guiding Mr Blair's actions? I've checked the New Testament and it doesn't seem to match Mr Blairs actions, and the Pope (considered an authority on this topic by many) feels the same way.

Is it perhaps Thor, Kali, or Aries?
</blockquote>

<p>I am also planning to ask if the Guided By God service could be part-privatised, and made available to businesses and organisations in the UK, but I think it would be wise to first check which deity is acting as supplier. Imagine what would happen if the god turned out to be a Babylonian god of chaos, or required the sacrifice of innocents.</p>

<p>I wonder how many lists I'm on now?</p>
