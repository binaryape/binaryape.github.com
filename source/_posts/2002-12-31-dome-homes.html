<p>We want <a href="http://www.monolithicdome.com/thedome/index.html">a dome  home</a>. Slightly 'Star Wars', a little 'Hobbit-hole', with a fair bit of <a href="http://www.rogerdean.com/architecture/">Roger Dean</a>. Roomy and cheap too. The main problem is that while the USA has lots of cheap  land so building new, wide structures isn't very expensive, in the UK we'd probably have to buy an existing building and remove it first. That said, it looks as if these can be turfed over, so the planners could be appeased by an almost invisible structure.</p>
