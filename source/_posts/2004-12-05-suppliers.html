<p>Some general recommendations from my flat renovation project:</p>

<ul>
<li>New central heating: <a href="http://www.aubreycornfoot.co.uk/home.html">Aubrey Cornfoot</a>. Excellent work, doing more than was in actually in the spec to make everything tidy.</li>
<li>New windows: Jenkinson Glaziers. Nice windows, well fitted, and they organised scaffolding and exterior painting too. I signed off the job spec without noticing the bathroom fan was replaced by one in the kitchen though. Doh.</li>
<li>Plumbing: Aquaflow. They properly unblocked the bath and replaced the kitchen plumbing</li>
<li>Decorating: Jeff Campbell. Managed to turn a dirty old flat into something that looked so nice it looked nothing like my flat anymore. Took a while longer than I'd thought though.</li>
</ul>
