<p>Someone has ported <a href="http://www.uni-mainz.de/~bauec002/B2Main.html">Basilisk II</a> to run on the <a href="http://myzaurus.com">Sharp Zaurus</a>! Add a classic Mac ROM file and System 7.1, and you've got a pocket sized 68k Mac. At the moment it requires running X11, which is a  bit of a pain.  A port of UAE to the Zaurus is also available, but there is no way it's going to run properly on a 200MHz ARM.</p>
