<p>I knew that  the Savannah Theory (once the conventional wisdom) was looking weak, but I hadn't realised that the Aquatic Ape theory was doing so well. Excellent!</p>

<p>We clearly didn't develop to live on the open plains of Africa (our really dilute urine is more than a hint) and we're packed with features closely associated with life on the coast. The idea that recent human ancestors lived <em>in</em> the sea is rather silly, but the idea that we were primarily a shoreline animal has a lot to support it.</p>

<p>My own pet extensions of this idea are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mankind spread around the earth by following the shoreline first, then moving inland as populations increased. </li>
<li>We are strangely attracted to the sea even now. Give people a choice of where to go to relax, and most of them will choose the sea.</li>
<li>Dogs love beaches too, and they evolved with us. As 'Science' this one is rubbish, but it's my idea and I like it. So there.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, that's just stuff I thought of while soaking in a bath, so I was quite pleased to see that coastal migration is A Proper Theory :-)</p>
