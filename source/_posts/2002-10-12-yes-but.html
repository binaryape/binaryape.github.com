<p>I wouldn't normally post a "oooh,  Microsoft have a security problem" item (fish, a barrel, a gun...) but this is wonderful:</p>

<p><i>"Outlook Express ships with every Windows system, or rather as part of IE, so it's on every system. But unless it is configured to receive mail, you are not at risk," said Scott Culp, manager for Microsoft security response.</i></p>

<p>So as long as you don't use it, you're safe. Phew.</p>
