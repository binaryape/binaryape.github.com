<p>There are special train services from Manchester called "Folk Trains". Folk bands play on the trains, then at a pub at the destination, and then accompany everyone back to Manchester Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Some trains play "folky" folk (possible risk of "Streets of London"! Be alert!) while others feature genres like blues, jazz, skiffle, even Eastern European and Jewish.</p>

<p>There's a lot of potential for other themed train services.</p>
