<p>I've upgraded from an old version of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. Installing Wordpress was very easy, importing my old MT data was easy, but I've added hundreds of mod_rewrite lines to stop broken links, and that wasn't easy. Most of them should only apply for connections to the old archive, and as they are  permanent redirects, search engines etc should hopefully adjust themselves and make the redirections rarely used.</p>

<p>Next I'll update the site style, and then rebuild the other parts of www.binary-ape.org. More changes soon. Now I'm off back to BAXL/FLJUD work.</p>
