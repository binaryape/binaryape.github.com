<p>A page that at first glance is full of "stupid" comments by web designer's clients. While many of the quotes deserve laughter, I think that some of them actually show a lot more about the <i>designer's</i> ignorance, rather than the client's:</p>

<ul>
<li>"our web site doesn't load if I turn javascript off ... please fix this"</li>
<li>"well I dont like pages who has loading when u get to the website, I dont want' to haft to wait"</li>
</ul>

<p>(Spelling from the designers, I suspect)</p>

<p>I must admit that a page from my late-90s website took so long to render on a 200Mhz Mac, you could probably go off and make a cup of tea in the meantime, as I was relying on some extraordinary table-layout-abuse. Sorry.</p>
