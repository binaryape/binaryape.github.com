<p>"Mr Weaver said there was no need for people to start fearing an onslaught of badger attacks."</p>

<p>I'm childishly amused by people who go for short walks in the Lake District, in warm weather, along managed paths, laden with hundreds of pounds-worth of boots, multilayer survival garments, multiple maps, flasks, and odd walking sticks. It's best to be careful if climbing a difficult hill in changeable weather, but I often joke that someone in suburbia is telling tales of giant bear-like badgers, packs of terrible man-hunting foxes, and moles that can drag a full-grown man to his doom.</p>

<p>"Have you packed the fox-repellent spray dear?"
"Yes, and I've sharpened the anti-badger stick too. Remember poor George, they only found his feet."
"I'll pack the flare gun too, just in case."</p>

<p>Of course, now a real badger has now gone on a violent suburban rampage, I expect walkers with tasers and bayonets.</p>

<p>The poor thing was killed, but he managed to chew up a man's arm rather badly and chase policemen, so a dog wouldn't have expected anything better.</p>
