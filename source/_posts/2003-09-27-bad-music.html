<p>JPop: Bad, but fun. This gives me the urge to jump around with a manga-size grin. It's so insanely stupidly happy that the artless, disposable soulless side of it is forgivable. I love the tune on the <a href="http://www.savtheworld.com/html/molly.php3">Molly, Star-Racer</a> trailer.</p>

<p>Gabber/Hardcore: The worst music ever, made worse by drunken aggressive morons in shell suits shouting over the top, and then being played in an antisocial way (personal stereo, boy racer car, a garden a mile away, always too loud). The infected zombies in '28 Days Later' were probably listening to this on personal stereos.</p>

<p>Good, got that off my chest.</p>
