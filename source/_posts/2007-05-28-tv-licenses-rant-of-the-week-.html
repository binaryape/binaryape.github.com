<p>So then, it seems that:</p>

<p>It's OK to bomb a state TV station (killing journalists) because they were<em> showing propaganda</em> (Serbia's RTS)
It's OK to bomb independent TV stations (killing journalists) because they were <em>showing propaganda</em>. (Al Jazeera)</p>

<p>But it's not OK to legally withdraw a broadcast license for a TV station (without killing the journalists) that <em>shows propaganda</em>. And was involved in a coup against a democratically elected government. (RCTV) Doing that would be terrible blow against freedom of speech! (RCTV can now only be seen on cable)</p>

<p>This 'act of revenge' by Chavez is years after the attempted coup, so it would definitely be a dish served cold. How long would an Al Qaeda funded and staffed TV station remain on air in the USA or UK?</p>

<p>I'm not one of the many people who idolise Hugo Chavez (I think he's a demagogue and thug) but there seems to be a rather disproportionate media outcry against his withdrawal of a broadcast license for RCTV. Even<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/05/27/venezuelan_media_cra.html"> BoingBoing is joining in</a>.</p>

<p>[When NATO bombed RTS I was working in a British TV studio building. Did the RTS technicians and hairdressers deserve to die any more than the ones I passed in the corridor? Not renewing a broadcast license is rather mild in comparison.]</p>
