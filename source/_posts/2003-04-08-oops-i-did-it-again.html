<p>During the recent war in Afghanistan, US troops "accidentally" destoyed the al-Jazeera offices in Kabul. Today they managed to "accidentally" destroy the al-Jazeera offices in Baghdad, killing a journalist, but also managed to "accidentally" attack the offices of Abu Dhabi television.</p>

<p>The Palestine Hotel, housing most of the foriegn journalists in Baghdad, was also attacked today. Two people were killed.</p>

<p>In the Kosovo conflict, US forces deliberately bombed a Serbian TV station, killing studio staff.</p>

<p>Kate Adie claims to have been warned, just before this war, that unapproved journalists would be targeted by the USA military. <a href='http://baltimore.indymedia.org/newswire/display_printable/3521/index.php'>Is this threat being carried out?</a> Reporting from a war zone is obviously rather dangerous, but these attacks have been against known neutral locations.</p>

<p>Then there's the tragic and mysterious deaths of Gaby Rado and Terry Lloyd.</p>

<p>I generally don't have a high opinion of journalists, but I'm beginning to admire the bravery and undaunted professionalism of many war reporters, especially the non-"embedded" ones.</p>
