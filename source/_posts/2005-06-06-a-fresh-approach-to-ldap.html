<p>On the one hand, this makes much of what I've been working on in the evenings for the past year a little redundant... but for my day job, this could be very, very useful.</p>

<p>Penrose is an LDAP server that presents data stored in other, existing backends (SQL databases or  LDAP servers, probably) as a fully structured LDAP directory.</p>

<p>OpenLDAP can use a variety of backends, including SQL, and act as a proxy, but it can be rather fiddly. The Flash demo of Penrose makes it look very nice indeed, integrating the configuration GUI with a directory browser.</p>

<p>And if you think it looks a little like Active Directory, you'd be right, and this is exactly what Open Source 'proper' LDAP needs.</p>

<p>I wonder what the performanceis is like? OpenLDAP is rather fast now, and I'm still sceptical about Java's performance for things like this.</p>
