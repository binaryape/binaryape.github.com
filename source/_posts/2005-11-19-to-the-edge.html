<p>I've wanted to visit Alderley Edge ever since reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/000712788X/qid=1132412755/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-6570647-9177437">'The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'</a>  as a child, and I've finally got round to it.<br />
<br />
The local library were very helpful and gave me a copy of an old geological map of the area.<br />
<br />
The Edge is just as I imagined it when reading the books, although without any obvious supernatural creatures, and with National Trust pathways. It really is a fascinating and beautiful place.
