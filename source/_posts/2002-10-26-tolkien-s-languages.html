<p>A very detailed resource for Tolkien's invented languages. It even includes <a href="http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/qcourse.htm">a free course on Quenya</a> (High Elvish). JRR Tolkien didn't publish his languages (as they were mainly a private hobby), so this site includes a huge amount of research gathered from many sources. Only <a href="http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/quenya.htm">Quenya</a> and <a href="http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/sindarin.htm">Sindarin</a> are complete enough to actually use as functional languages.</p>
