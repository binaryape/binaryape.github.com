<p>My personal recommendation is <a href="http://www.earthcafe.co.uk/">Earth Cafe</a>, where you can get free wifi plus excellent organic vegan food, in a pleasant, friendly little room under the Buddhist Centre. I think the wifi is only available off-peak, as Earth can get rather busy at lunch and dinner.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mancubist.co.uk/2007/02/22/where-can-you-find-free-wi-fi-access-in-manchester-city-centre">Mancubist</a> has created a Google Maps <a href="http://www.communitywalk.com/map/70522">page listing other free wifi providers in Manchester city centre</a>.</p>
