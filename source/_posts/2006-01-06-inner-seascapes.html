<p>I often have dreams featuring beaches, coastal towns and the sea, but over the last couple of weeks I've been having many more dreams about the sea: twilight seascapes with distant lights, beaches of slate-grey sand stretching away into the darkness, mist flowing over rolling, inky seas, me walking along deserted piers at night while waves crash underneath...</p>

<p>Today I realised why. My evening web wanderings include Flickr, and the excellent photos of two ex-colleagues: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/raybyrne/">Ray Byrne</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mysteryme/">Gary Shrimpling</a>. You might notice the recurring theme recently.</p>

<p>I will now feel responsible if either of them has nightmares about penguins or 1980s game characters.</p>
