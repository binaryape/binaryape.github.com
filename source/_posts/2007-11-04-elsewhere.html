<p>I came across this image while reading <a href="http://www.oobaloo.co.uk/">a technical blog</a>, and for a moment thought it was an unusual photo of Albert Square in Manchester. Then A. wandered in and also momentarily mistook it for Albert Square.<br />
<br />
It's actually Grand Place in Brussels.
