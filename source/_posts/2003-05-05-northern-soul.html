<p>I've often stumbled across references to "Northern Soul". I knew that it was a musical genre popular in the North West of England and that it heavily influenced the early house music scene in Manchester. I didn't actually know what it was.</p>

<p>Thanks to a Â£5 compilation CD from Sainsburys, <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000025A6Q/qid=1052142793/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_3_2/202-5344036-4645427'>'Northern Soul Memories'</a>, I now know what Northern Soul is: not a genre, more a massive playlist of the most funky and danceable old Motown style soul. Not made in Wigan, but played in Wigan.</p>

<p>It's very good, and nothing at all like the trashy "soul" that dominated the charts during the 1980s.  "Double Cookin' " by Checkerboard Squares reminds me of Lemon Jelly, and  'Quittin' time' by Kansas City Playboys starts off sounding remarkably like a drum and bass tune.</p>
