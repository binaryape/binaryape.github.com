<p>Another summer of overwork is winding down now, a bit earlier this year. I'm definitely a seasonal workaholic (I've kept a timesheet this year, much to my own discomfort) but I can't keep doing this, I'm not being fair to Arteth, or myself really. Now I'm trying to develop (and really enjoying) photography as a hobby I'm finding myself drawn away from sitting at a keyboard all day, which is good when I actually manage it.</p>
