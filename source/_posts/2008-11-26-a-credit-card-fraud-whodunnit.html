I have a credit card that I have used twice, both times in reputable online stores. I have no PIN number, I have not used it in a cashpoint, I have never handed it to someone. Somehow it's been accessed and used by a thief. My bank spotted the unusual transactions so there's no long-term harm but I'm left wondering which of the two companies leaked/lost/stole my details.
