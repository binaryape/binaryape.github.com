<p>The <a>Invader</a> outside Piccadilly Railway Station disappeared over Christmas, along with it's concrete block. I've heard that the concrete block made it difficult to clear litter nearby so the whole thing was removed.<br /></p>

<p>I'll try to find out what happened to the invader. Letters and emails have been sent.<br /></p>
