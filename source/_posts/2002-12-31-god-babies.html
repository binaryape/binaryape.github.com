<p>When Anne Widdecomb said "Jesus Christ said suffer the little ones to come unto me, not that they should be eaten for public entertainment" she was right, but her god isn't <i>completely</i> against the eating of babies. Far from it - baby eating is something he seems to have a thing about. Deuteronomy 28:53, for example. Or Leviticus 26:22, 29,  Lamentations 2:20, 4:10, Kings 6:28-29, 33, Isaiah 49:26, and maybe a few more.</p>

<p>Disturbing.</p>
