<p><a href="http://www.verisign.com">Verisign</a>, entrusted with running part of the Internet's infrastructure for the good of all, have effectively broken it, in a particularly feeble way, to boost profits.</p>

<p>Instead of a DNS lookup on their servers returning 'failure' on a non-existant domain, it now returns 'success', and directs the user to an advertising page. This breaks a whole pile of software which needs to test if a domain exists or not. It also ignores the standard, and voluntary standards compliance holds the Internet together more than any technology. This is a very bad precedent from a supposedly responsible company. It shows either astonishingly bad technical knowledge, incompetent management, or downright irresponsible greed.</p>
