<p>In 2003 I made a bet with a colleague. The colleague (let's call him Neil) insisted that Gordon Brown would <em>never</em> be Prime Minister. I said that he would. The winner gets a CD of their choice. Note the clear advantage I've got here - I don't really have to pay up until Gordon Brown is actually dead.</p>

<p>I've had the CD selected for years: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006IU8C/qid=1146944885/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/202-6570647-9177437">Run DMC Greatest Hits.</a>. I've avoided buying it myself. It's my Blair Has Gone CD.</p>

<p>Brown <i>seems</i> to be making his move now...</p>
