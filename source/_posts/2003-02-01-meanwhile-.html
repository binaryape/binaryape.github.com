<p>Asterix and Obelix return to the village and find that the Village Chief Vitalstatistix has apparently invited the Romans to stay. From now on, all heroic defences of the village will have to be approved by five Roman officers before proceeding. Getafix the druid may only use Roman-approved herbs. Will Obelix have to carry a Roman altar, despite being a menhir expert?</p>
