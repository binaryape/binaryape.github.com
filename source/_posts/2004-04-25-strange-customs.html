<p>Reading this article, it struck me that in many ways "The West" must seem to have it's fair share of strange sexual culture when viewed by people in the Far East, not least the practise of circumcision in the USA.</p>

<p>The practice of removing 70% of the nerves in your son's penis was originally popular in the USA because it was suppose to limit masturbation, then continued because of suspiciously profitable bad science, and now survives mainly because it's "normal". This is exactly the kind of behaviour that the modern, liberal, rational, scientific West thinks it has left behind.</p>
