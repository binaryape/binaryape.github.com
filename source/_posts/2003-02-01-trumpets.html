<p>I was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,875191,00.html">very briefly mentioned</a> in The Guardian a couple of weeks ago in an article on the <a href="http://www.lazyweb.org">Lazyweb</a> idea. This is my first appearance outside the Guardian's letters page.  I admit it: I've written letters to the Guardian, just one small step away from writing letters to Home Truths. Which I have to confess, I listen to every weekend. I also plan to grow a proper beard one day, but I digress.</p>

<p>A relatively large website which I struggled to maintain way back in the mid-1990s was once Slashdotted, back in the days when that meant something*, and was later recommended as reading material to the USA's Department of Justice in <a href="http://lists.essential.org/1998/info-policy-notes/msg00031.html">a letter</a>  by Ralph Nader and James Love. I'm still quite proud of this. Alas, the pressures of fame, Claris HomePage and my site's god-awful colour scheme  proved too much for me, and I passed the site on to someone else, and retired with the $40 of Amazon Associate fees I'd earned. I let the dotcom bubble pass me by, (which wasn't difficult) and focused on my day job and reading a dangerous number of  O'Reilly books.</p>

<p>*Back before the term was actually used, I suspect, which makes that statement mean even less.</p>
