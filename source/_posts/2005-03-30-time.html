<p>I've  been quickly adding posts to this thing in draft mode for months but not actually publishing them, so now I've got a long waiting list of extra, out-of-date rubbish to be added. I think I'll keep the original dates... Too much to do right now, and I don't think I'm doing anything particularly well. As as a result, I've given in to the Mac-worshipping blogging techie peer group pressure and bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0749922648/026-5691963-0042824">"GTD"</a> book... I could have got more done had I not spent most of Easter being sick.</p>

<p>And I had no chocolate at all, at Easter. The End Times Are Upon Us.</p>
