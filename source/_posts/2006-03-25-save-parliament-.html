<p>More unpleasantness from NeoLabour:</p>

<blockquote>
The boringly-named Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill is in fact a very dangerous piece of legislation. It grants any minister the ability to amend, replace, or repeal existing legislation. The frightening thing is this: they would be able to make major changes to the law without Parliament being able to examine it properly, taking away the ability of Parliament to meaningfully represent the citizens of this country.
</blockquote>

<p>Please write to your MP. Writing to your MP might not be much use now but if this bill goes through it might be the last time writing to your MP will be of any use at all.</p>
