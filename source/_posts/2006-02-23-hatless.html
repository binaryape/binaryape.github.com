<p>I have lost my hat!</p>

<p>Even worse, I have no idea <i>how</i> I've lost my hat. As far as I can work out it vanished from inside my bag. I've been wandering around the flat looking in increasingly unlikely places.</p>

<p>It had a ¬£5 note in it too. And a blank please-return-if-lost label.</p>

<p>Curses.</p>
