<p>Last year I stumbled upon a picture of a rabbit balancing a pancake on its head. The page was in Japanese, so I had no idea why the rabbit had a pancake on its head. The rabbit didn't seem to mind.</p>

<p>Thanks to a link on <a href="http://www.metafilter.org/">Metafilter</a>, I've just found <a href="http://www.fsinet.or.jp/~sokaisha/rabbit/rabbit.htm">a huge site</a> dedicated to photos of the same rabbit, <a href="http://isweb21.infoseek.co.jp/animal/sokaisha/021006/021006.htm">Oolong</a>.  His owner has the strange habit of balancing small objects on his head and then taking photos. I'm a bit disturbed by <a href="http://www.fsinet.or.jp/~sokaisha/rabbit/010406/010406.htm">this one</a>, but Oolong seems to <a href="http://isweb21.infoseek.co.jp/animal/sokaisha/021017/021017.htm">live</a> a <a href="http://isweb21.infoseek.co.jp/animal/sokaisha/020526/020526.htm">happy</a>, <a href="http://isweb21.infoseek.co.jp/animal/sokaisha/020216/020216.htm">varied</a> and <a href="http://www.fsinet.or.jp/~sokaisha/rabbit/soriasobi/soriasobi.htm">adventurous</a> life, very different to the <a href="http://www.therabbitcharity.freeserve.co.uk/ditch.html">lonely lives of most pet rabbits</a> in Britain.</p>
