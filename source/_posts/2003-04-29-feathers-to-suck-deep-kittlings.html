<p><a href="http://www.spikemagazine.com/0800jeffnoon.htm">Jeff Noon</a> on the death of the Vurt-Manchester locations. I've got mixed feeling about the New Manchester changes - there was <em>something</em> <i>almost</i> romantic about the urban decay, but that didn't make <b>living</b> in it easier.</p>

<p>"If you look at The Smiths and Joy Division, you've got a light and dark thing going on there, a reflection of what was going on in the city at the time. Whereas, with the new Manchester thing, the 'New Manchester' people, they're trying to pave over the darkness."</p>
