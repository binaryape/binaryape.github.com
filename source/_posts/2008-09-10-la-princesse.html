The crowd stayed, watching the spider.<br /><br />I've not really been to Liverpool city centre before, so we went for a wander for a few hours and had a rather good meal at a nice Chinese restaraunt called <a href="http://www.yuetben.co.uk/">Yeut Ben</a>, then went back to Lime Street to watch La Princesse as she woke up.<br /><br />The evening was absolutely wonderful, not just the spider itself but the music and the crowd.  La Princesse was a truly fantastic work of engineering but had personality too, from the excellent performance of her operators. <br /><br />I'm also really pleased that I managed to get <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/binaryape/sets/72157607180613461/">some photos from the back of the crowd</a>, in the dark. The video clip above was taken as La Princesse approached the end of her visit.<br clear="all" /></p>
