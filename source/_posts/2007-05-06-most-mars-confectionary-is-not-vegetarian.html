<p>While the general trend is for more products to become veggie friendly, even vegan, Mars have changed their recipes to include rennet, stomach juice from animals. From 1 May 2007 many of their most common pseudo-chocolates are no longer veggie.</p>

<p>To their credit Mars did contact The Vegetarian Society to warn them, so at least they are being fair and honest about this.</p>

<p>(Footrant: I stopped eating any confectionary that wasn't organic or fair trade over ten years ago. Mass-market chocolate production involves slavery, pollution and violence. Vegetarians should avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Chocolate">Big Chocolate</a> products because they're made by child slaves, not just because they're made with rennet. Most Mars, Cadbury and Nestle 'chocolate' products are utter junk anyway.)</p>
