I've combined them and got a few interesting photos.<br /><br />I have never had a cough/cold like this before. I've coughed so much I've fallen down and seen strange blue lights fill my vision and been convinced something is going to burst. I've been reassured that these are probably man-flu symptoms, and it seems I'm likely to survive. My voice has been mostly gone since Tuesday but has gone through periods of channeling Darth Vader, Johny Cash (the neighbours suffered 'Ring of Fire' interrupted by coughing fits), voiceless zombie and currently late period Bob Dylan.<br /><br />Anyway, the syrup worked photographically at least.<br clear="all" /></p>
