<p><img src="/miscimages/curses.jpg" style="float:left;position:relative;margin-bottom:10px margin-right: 5px;">I'm going to leave Jabber/LDAP integration alone for the rest of today, I'm getting nothing more than LDAP error code 1 ("I/O Error Interrupted system call") on binds with Net::LDAP. I'm going to work on some backburner projects instead rather than waste the day chasing the cause of this. I don't think it's me.</p>
