<p>I've abandoned the cheapish floppy hat I bought last year to fend of the cruel, blistering rays of the sun, and got myself a Tilley Hat T3. So far I'm very impressed. If nothing else, this hat has the most advanced and cunning marketing material  I've ever seen, but it's still a genuinely nice bit of kit. They'll even sell me a replacement for half-price if this one is stolen or gets blown into the Medlock. It can resist both ultraviolet rays and the digestive system of an elephant, which aren't a risk in Manchester for most of the year, but it's reassuring all the same.</p>

<p>Of course, I look completely daft wearing it, but as the man in the shop said, "that's what hats are for.".</p>
