<p>I've clearly not been updating this weblog very often recently. One reason is that many of the smaller items in the past have been links to other sites, and these usually go into my Delicious bookmarks nowadays, and appear in the margin here automatically rather than as articles. I've also been posting photos on Flickr quite often.</p>

<p>For the last couple of months I've been busy at work and trying to get another release of <a href="http://jabberstudio.org/projects/fljud/project/view.php">FLJUD</a> finished. I've started a <a href="http://binary-ape.org/baxl/wiki/index.php?title=FLJUD">documentation wiki for FLJUD</a> too.</p>

<p>I've also been occupied by playing Resident Evil 4 and watching Rome and Lost, not productive, but good fun.</p>

<p>Hopefully I'll return to posting stuff on Ape Tracks more regularly.</p>
