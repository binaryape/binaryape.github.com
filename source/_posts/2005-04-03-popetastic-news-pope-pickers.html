<p>Looking at the BBC website today, there are at least 66 glowing stories on the late Pope, and <strong>1</strong> story that includes any criticism. In the "Your Views" pages, there isn't one critical view, despite the pages being introduced with the line: "The following comments reflect the balance of views received". Surely an angry Northern Irish Protestant or passionate American Evangelical, or anti-AIDs campaigner, or women's rights campaigner wrote in? It seems nobody isn't bothered at all, nobody disliked him. Or could this be the sensitive new post-'Jerry Springer The Opera' BBC?</p>

<p>It was interesting to learn that a Pope is declared dead after being hit on the head three times with a silver hammer while his name is called - if he doesn't answer, he's dead.</p>

<p>I didn't like him. And if he was right, he isn't even dead: he's much better off now, so why the fuss? It seems rather selfish to want the poor guy living on with a feeding tube, barely able to breathe or move, when he could be enjoying VIP status in everlasting paradise.</p>
