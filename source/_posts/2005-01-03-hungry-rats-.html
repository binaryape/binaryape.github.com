<p>I like the idea of the new "<a href="http://www.hungryrats.com">Hungry Rats</a>" public information campaign. Rats live off human rubbish - a clean city won't be swarming with rats. Much as I like rats in general, I'd rather not be faced with packs of The Hungry Rats.</p>

<p>The trouble is, rats aren't very scary. Most films now use CGI rats to make them look threatening. I think the video clip and 'facts' for the campaign are trying to make rats scarier than they really are. Why would rats be standing around all over the sleeping couple's duvet? Is this a message to stop eating biscuits in bed?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/afp/20041219/sc_afp/healthchinadrug_041219195649">Chinese idea of tasty rat contraceptives</a> might be worth trying too. A number of foods harmless to humans weaken or sterilise rats - tofu for instance.</p>
