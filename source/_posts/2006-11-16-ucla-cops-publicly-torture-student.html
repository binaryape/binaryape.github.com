<p>Now that things are getting settled after all the overtime, the September crunch at work, the house move, and the exploding home server, I've been meaning to start posting again with one of those <a href="http://www.jennshreve.com/thefblog/2006/10/sorry-i-havent-posted-in-awhile.html">traditional Why I've Not Updated My Blog excuses</a>. Later today. Maybe tomorrow. Just after I've finished what I'm doing.</p>

<p>Today I read this disturbing account of <a href="http://dailybruin.com/news/articles.asp?id=38958">what can happen at UCLA if you don't have a student card with you</a> when using a PC. The embedded video didn't play, but I'm used to that.</p>

<p>Then I saw this horrifying video of the event on the front page of YouTube:</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyvrqcxNIFs]</p>

<p>The police repeatedly tazer a screaming student because he can't stand up <strong>after being tazered</strong>. Cops threaten to tazer other students who ask for their details.</p>

<p>I hope the staff and students at UCLA stand up and make sure this doesn't happen again.</p>
