<p>The copyright status of Lovecraft's work is vague. It <a href="http://www.ech-pi-el.com/lovecraft/copyrights.htm">looks as if the copyright has lapsed</a>, so The H.P. Lovecraft Library has put a large amount of his work <a href="http://www.ech-pi-el.com/lovecraft/works/index.htm">online as both HTML and PDF documents</a>. This site is an excellent resource.</p>

<pre><code>    With the recent frenzy of new "Intellectual Property" laws in the USA and Europe, will this be possible for today's writers, or will their work just fade away as their publishers lose interest but hold onto the copyright?
