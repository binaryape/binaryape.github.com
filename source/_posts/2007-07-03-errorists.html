I don't know what's more worrying: that doctors make such amazingly bad terrorists (they didn't even manage to blow up the car. It just burned. Kids in North Shields can do better than that), that people so utterly inept can qualify as doctors, or that the media haven't noticed that these are the world's most useless terrorists.

I don't want them to be dangerous: I  think we'd be better off laughing at how crappy they are, rather then hyping them in the media and doing their work (spreading fear) for them.

The last lot of suicide bombers we had in the UK made flour fizzle and then got arrested on TV in their underpants. <strong>All</strong> suicide bombers should be like that.
