<p>I wonder how long it will be before we have a Windows XP PC running inside a Java box on a webpage... Old hardware doesn't die, it just becomes  software. You'll need a fast PC to run the Java based emulator.  <a href="http://www.igr.nl/users/vincentd/"> This one</a> will be faster but it needs downloading and installing first.</p>
