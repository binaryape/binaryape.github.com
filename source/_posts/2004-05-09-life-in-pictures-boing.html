<p>I tend to save good <a href="http://dilbert.com">Dilbert cartoons</a> to my harddisk*, although I've not done it so much recently. Which is a pity because following the recent classic <a href="http://www.pseudodictionary.com/word.php?id=473">Bungee Boss</a> incident at my previous employers, I couldn't find the cartoon. Grrr.</p>

<p>There really should be an option to subscribe to the full collection, and to publish playlists of favourites. I like the idea of being able to publish a weblog-like career diary using only Dilbert strips... <strike>I've suffered</strike>experienced Dilbert archetypes, and I've been some too. A Dilbert-diary wouldn't be much use to me now - as I'm now in the academic world, I seem to have pretty much dropped out of the Dilbert universe. You see Jeff, I wasn't writing them after all.</p>

<p>(*I do buy all the Dilbert books, so I'm paying Mr Adams. I bought some of the Dilbert food too, once. One day I'll get the Babylon 5 episode with Scott Adams in it on DVD.)</p>
