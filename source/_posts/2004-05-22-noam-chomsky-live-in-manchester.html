<p>My sister and I went to see Noam Chomsky give a talk in Manchester today, to a crowd of about 1000 people. It was a typical Chomsky topic, but he had a very engaging style, and subtle, dry humor. One of the things I find amusing in Chomsky's writing is that certain facts and phrases <em>always</em> crop up. Today we had to wait until the questions and answers session before he managed to slightly digress and get in all the mandatory bits. A Chomsky drinking game or bingo board might just work... I've been looking forward to this talk for six months or so, and it didn't disappoint.</p>

<p>One strange thing is that, according to rumor, Chomsky's hosts took him out for lunch, not at one of Manchester's many excellent ethical/organic/veggie restaurants, but "Harvey Nicks"! I suppose he would have been able to eat unrecognised and unhassled.</p>
