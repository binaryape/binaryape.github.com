<p>Not Harry. <strong>Beatrix</strong>. Project Gutenberg has a nice selection of B.P stories, with pictures.</p>

<p>Beatrix Potter would get my vote as Best Childrens Author Ever.  Her characters are fluffy, but her world isn't: there's adventure, but also danger.  I think this is better for children than cosy 'WInnie The Pooh' type stories, although I remember I found some Beatrix Potter a little scary...</p>

<p>Reading the line "<em>But Nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket</em>" in a whisper can make still me shiver.</p>
