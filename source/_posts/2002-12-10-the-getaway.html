<p>I'm disturbed by Channel 4/Film 4's obsession with gangster films. The TV adverts alone are glamourising a particularly nasty type of crime - they seem to be adverts for crime as much as films.</p>

<p>The Getaway is the perfect game for the Gangster-loving Nathans of London. In fact, it looks so good I've had to fight back the urge to buy it, and a Playstation 2, right now. And I'm not a crime fiction fan, I've never wanted to <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/screenshot.php3?name=/pics/screenshots/getaway_ps2/e307b.jpg">play at being a cop killer</a>, and I'm not <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/screenshot.php3?name=/pics/screenshots/getaway_ps2/e301b.jpg">a driving enthusiast</a>. I don't even like <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/screenshot.php3?name=/pics/screenshots/getaway_ps2/e302b.jpg">London</a>.</p>

<p>What  are games going to be like in another ten years?</p>
