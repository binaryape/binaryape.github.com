<a href="http://perlbuzz.com/2007/12/it-was-twenty-years-ago-today.html">Perl is 20 years old today</a>, and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl-5.10.0/">Perl 5.10</a> has been released, the first major new version for five years. Read <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rjbs/perl-510-for-people-who-arent-totally-insane">Perl 5.10 for people who are not totally insane</a> for a summary of the neat bits.

I can't mention Perl without feeling compelled to mention Ruby (the guilty conscience of a lapsed Perlist - I spend much more time with Ruby nowadays) so I'll add that Ruby will be 15 next year, a couple of years <em>older</em> than Java.
