<p>When I was half-way through the final dungeon in <a href="http://www.zelda.com/gcn/">Wind Waker</a> I suddenly realised that I was about to complete the game. No more sailing around in the rain. No more pointless rupee collection. What if I never work out what those windmill things and strange sockets do in the town? So I stopped playing. I can always finish it later.</p>

<p>It's happened again - I <em>almost</em> beat Ganon in <a href="http://www.zelda.com/universe/game/twilightprincess/">Twilight Princess</a> on my first attempt,  before realising that I was about to finish the game. After about 80 hours I had almost reached the end. What about the other hearts? I've not done everything properly - insects, poes, flight-by-chicken tricks. I've not raced against Yeta yet!</p>

<p>It's good to know what's left: <a href="http://ict-4-me.com/~jennings/Other/Wii/Zelda/index.html">The Twilight Calculator</a></p>

<p>So Ganondorf can wait. I'm off looking for golden bugs.</p>
