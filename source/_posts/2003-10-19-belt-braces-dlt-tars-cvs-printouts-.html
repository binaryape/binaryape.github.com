<p>I haven't upgraded the OS on my home server for years, and since I've got some time away from work, a new Mandrake is out, and I'm just about to start another intensive round of Hippo development, this is probably the best opportunity I'll get for a long time. Professionally I wouldn't do this without a week or so of watching the new OS and waiting for other people to find the bugs*, but, well, it's now or next year, and it's a point-two release, so there shouldn't be anything too risky <em>cough</em> <em>cough</em></p>

<p>I've been backing up in various ways for four hours now.</p>

<p>There doesn't appear to be any source code for the Linux kernel on Mandrake's free download version of 9.2. Three CDs, no kernel code. Why?</p>

<p>*That's why I hand out copies of the CDs at work. I'm devious.</p>
