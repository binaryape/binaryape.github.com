<p>Something I often wonder about while reading magazines, seeing posters, or watching TV: why are women's nipples dangerous? What is it about women's nipples that causes them to be airbrushed out of the British and American media? Breasts are deemed acceptable, but not female nipples. Do they corrupt people in some way? Men's nipples are commonly shown in adverts. Women's nipples, even nipples under clothing, are edited out.</p>

<p>Something to remember the next time Islamic dress codes are criticised by smug western pundits.</p>

<p>Here's an interesting page on this subject. I like <a href="http://www.minitru.org/words/breasts.png">the cartoon</a>.</p>
