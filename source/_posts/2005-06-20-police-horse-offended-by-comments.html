<blockquote>Brown inquired, ‚ÄúHow do you feel about your horse being gay?‚Äù of one of the policemen, stating that his colleague‚Äôs was clearly not gay. After repeated comments on the sexuality of his horse, and despite warnings from the policeman about his behaviour, Brown‚Äôs offer of an apology to the horse was rejected and he was handcuffed and taken by the officers to the police station.</blockquote>
