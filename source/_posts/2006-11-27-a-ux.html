<blockquote>Apple Unix (A/UX) is Apple's port of Unix to the original Macintosh. Specifically, it's a port of AT&amp;T Unix System V.2.2 (with a handful of BSD-extensions) to Macintosh systems that were based on the Motorola 680x0 line of processors. You might be asking, "Another port of Unix... What's so special about that?" Well, A/UX combines the stability of Unix System V with the friendly graphical-user-interface (GUI) of the Macintosh Operating system. This hybrid-environment allows you to run both Macintosh and Unix programs on a single system. Sounds vaguely familiar, doesn't it?</blockquote>
