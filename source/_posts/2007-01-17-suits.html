<p>That would give me an interesting range of stuff to wear...</p>

<p>I can't stand wearing suits. It's like being in drag, or fancy dress. Disguising myself in someone else's uniform. Expensive, uncomfortable, impractical. I'm very glad I don't need to.</p>

<p>People who <strong>choose</strong> to wear suits (believing that suits impress or make them seem more professional) are unaware of the impression many people actually get. With any luck the damn things will die out in a decade or so.</p>
