<p>Computers need to do more of this sort of thing: as you type a US zip code, the map visually narrows the code's coverage down to the precise location on a map of the USA.</p>

<p>It's interesting to see how the very finite namespace of the zip number is divided across the different regions. If settlement patterns change a great deal, the allocations wouldn't work. They'd have to <i>add a number!</i></p>
