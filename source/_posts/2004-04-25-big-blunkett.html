<p>I'm now convinced that David Blunkett is not misled, ignorant or just stupid - he's clearly barking mad.</p>

<p>His <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3656945.stm">latestest claim</a> is that his identity card panacea could have prevented the Madrid bombings. Is he suggesting that commuters will have to authenticate themselves with his magic cards in order to get on a train or bus? Given that even the best fingerprint systems have 1/1000 failure rates, that will be interesting: "Sorry I'm late - got arrested for identity fraud again!"</p>

<p>I'm puzzled by the process for getting one of these ID cards - when we go to get an ID card, we'll obviously need to prove our ID, with one of the supposedly inadequate existing documents. So if I had, let's say, a fake passport, surely I could get myself a fake Blunkett-card?</p>
