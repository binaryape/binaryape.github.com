<p>I'm worrying a lot this week, despite my arms <a href="http://www.newcastlesportsinjury.co.uk/therapist_profiles.html">working properly again</a>, despite being stitch-free and healed, despite being <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/images/dilbert2003021522596.gif">numbed</a> for over six months. Today I've even managed to worry about <a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~phoenix/vinge/vinge-sing.html">The Singularity</a>, which really is a daft thing to worry about.</p>
