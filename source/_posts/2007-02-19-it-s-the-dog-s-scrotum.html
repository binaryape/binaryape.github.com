<p>Apparently there are people, <em>librarians</em> no less, who think that children between the ages of nine and twelve should not be exposed to the word "scrotum" in a book. Even if it's a dog's scrotum.</p>

I originally rambled on here about the daftness of all this, but I've deleted it - Neil Gaiman has covered the whole topic very well in these three posts, so if you're interested, read on:</p>

<p>It's not easy to be a brave librarian in areas where book burning mobs can camp outside your door.</p>
