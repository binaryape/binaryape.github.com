<p>Geo-location services are going to be very important soon - all sorts of data will be linked to locations, and accessed in many ways. For this to work, we'll need a good way to precisely and concisely refer to particular locations.</p>

<p>Postal addresses don't really relate the the real world, only a postal route. Postcodes are too vague and unstandardised. Latitude and Longitude aren't very friendly: try 54.9724565159566, -1.59792521092372, for example.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nacgeo.com/">The Universal Address system</a> seems to be a great solution: "An eight character Universal Address can uniquely specify every building in the world. A ten-character Universal Address can uniquely specify any square meter in the world. They are easily remembered, can be pinpointed on all maps and navigated with GPS receivers."</p>

<p>There's <a href="http://www.travelgis.com/geocode/Default.aspx">a demo page </a> where you can try it out. The coordinates above  became a Universal Address of <b>GV04N S4TV1</b>, much neater.</p>

<p>Sadly the format is very restrictively<a href="http://www.nacgeo.com/nacsite/licensing/">copyrighted and licensed</a>, so I can't use it, and I wouldn't recommend anyone uses it at all for this reason - the idea of a company owning the format of <i>address</i> data is silly and a little scary. Hopefully we won't have to wait long for a nice open ISO standard instead.</p>
