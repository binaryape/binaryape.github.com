There's a fascinating <a href="http://wikileaks.org/wiki/British_National_Party_Language_and_Concepts_Discipline_Manual%2C_July_2005">internal document from the BNP up on Wikileaks</a>.
</p><p>
Rule #2 is rather revealing:
</p><blockquote>
<span style="font-family:Times;">"The BNP is not a ‘fascist’ or ‘fascistic,’ let alone a ‘Nazi’ or ‘neo-Nazi’ or ‘national socialist’ party. </span><span style="font-family:Times;"><em>It should never be referred to as such by BNP activists</em></span><span style="font-family:Times;">, and anyone else who does so must be politely but firmly corrected."</span>
</blockquote><p>
(My italics)
</p><p>
So the BNP's <strong>own members</strong> are in the habit of calling their organisation 'fascist', 'nazi' and 'national socialist', and leadership want them to use a euphemism instead. An honest organisation would admit to being what it's members think it is. The BNP are old fashioned racists wrapped up in marketing bullshit. Rule #2 shows Rule #5 to be some impressive doublethink...
