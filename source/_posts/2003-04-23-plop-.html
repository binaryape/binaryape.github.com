<p>Good news for water voles.</p>

<p>It's strange and sad that things like water voles and sparrows might become extinct - they were once such normal, everyday things. I'm not at all sure about blaming mink for the decrease in water vole populations. I think that it's more likely to be the fault of industrial farming, just as it is with sparrows.</p>
