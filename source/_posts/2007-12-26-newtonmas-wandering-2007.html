<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/binaryape/sets/72157603539453894/">Another walk around an almost deserted Manchester</a>, relatively early in the morning, with a little fog this time.

Two surprises: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36397453@N00/2135116873/">rather unseasonal roses</a> growing in Castlefield, and seeing a kingfisher in Castlefield. Earlier this year I thought I'd seen a kingfisher zipping down the Ashton Canal but almost convinced myself I was mistaken. This time it was quite definitely a kingfisher. Their feathers are bright seen against a rural background, against grey concrete and black canal water they're almost dazzling. I failed to photograph the roses (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36397453@N00/2135116873/">A. managed it</a>) and the kingfisher was almost impossible to follow with the eye, nevermind a camera.
</p><p>
In about 20 years of living in Warwickshire I saw one kingfisher. This year in Manchester I've seen kingfishers twice. I suppose Manchester's post-industrial canals are now much cleaner than the rural rivers of 1970s Warwickshire, even if they're rather less verdant.
