I can still vividly remember how much I wanted a computer, and how happy I was to eventually get one*. For some children today a computer would cost their parents' annual income.

There are going to be disappointments, and problems, and scandals, but the project is marvellous and will improve people's lives - not just the children's but their families and communities. The "give them food instead" argument is both astonishingly ignorant and somewhere between patronising and downright racist. Most people in the world have enough food, and have enough clothes - they need access to education, information and communication, tools to create things, and a voice.
