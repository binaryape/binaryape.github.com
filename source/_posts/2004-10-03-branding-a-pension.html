<p>I've skipped paying into a pension this year due to a shortage of cash, but I have a small amount frozen in a quite decent pension scheme from a previous job. They're now renaming this to "The ITV Pension". Aaargh. The idea of a pension linked to this <a href="http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=1857">chamber of horrors</a> really doesn't inspire feelings of confidence and security. It's disturbing enough to link a pension to the letters "TV", an industry flickering and buzzing like an almost dead lightbulb, without prepending the "I". Time for something else.</p>
