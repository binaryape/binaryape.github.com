There a few things less interesting than bloggers blogging about their  blogging. Stop reading now.
</p><p>
Well, you were warned...
</p><p>
I'm building up a new collection of unpublished blog entries again, although it's nowhere close to the previous queue of over 700 abandoned items. I'll often quickly write a few  hundred words about something and then abandon the item.
</p><p>
It's hard to believe there's anything close to quality control going on here, but I only seem to publish about one eighth of the items I type into <a href="http://infinite-sushi.com/software/ecto/">Ecto</a>. Writing something is easy, editing something is much more time consuming. If the item is trivial then it's easy to post, but if the item's got actual content then I feel uneasy publishing it and tend to leave it in limbo until it's too late to be of use.
</p><p>
Most of the best things in the backlog are related to my day job and overlap with a great deal of the links I add to <a href="http://del.icio.us/binaryape/">Del.icio.us</a> each day. I've been toying with the idea of starting a second weblog for a while now, and I think I might as well have a go. I'll keep Apetracks as a relatively useless personal writing exercise while also posting to a blog dedicated to identity and directory tech. I'm already amassing a lot of information on this topic for my own use so sharing any gems I come across may be of use to other people. I'm not an IDM guru but I am rather active at the 'coal face'; there are plenty of blogs written by IDM consultants but few written by people who deal with real IDM issues day-to-day.
</p><p>
I'll have a go at actually publishing some content to the new blog before announcing it.
</p><p>
I'm also going to try posting some of the backlog this time rather than just deleting it.
</p><p>
While Apetracks isn't often updated <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/binaryape/">my Flickr photostream</a> gets updates almost every week, and my  <a href="http://del.icio.us/binaryape/">Del.icio.us</a> feed at least once a day.
