<p>In between the endless miserable business of flat-hunting we've been working our way through the excellent Ghost In the Shell TV series 'Stand Alone Complex'.</p>

<p>One of the interesting aspects of the series is how the AIs seem more human than the humans. As a viewer you end up caring more about the fate of the software than the people - despite them having a shape that is completely non-human (and non-mammalian) we felt more empathy with the Tachikoma than the human characters.</p>

<p>Forget flying cars; I want The Future to provide me with a spider-like robotic battle robot or two.</p>
