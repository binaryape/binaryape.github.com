<p><a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a> looks like a convenient way to update weblogs, so I'm giving it a try. (If you can't get Ecto working with Wordpress 2.1, try upgrading to Wordpress 2.1.1, which fixes xmlrpc problems fetching categories for entries - Ecto would hang with 2.1)</p>

<p>On the other hand Ecto seems unable to save any of my settings at the moment, which diminishes the convenience somewhat...¬† Update: It saved settings after I posted this.</p>
