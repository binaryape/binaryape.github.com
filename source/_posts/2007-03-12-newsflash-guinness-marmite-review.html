<p>I've finally got hold of some Guinness <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmite">Marmite</a> (thanks Helen!) and we've tested it on some toast.</p>

<p>According to the polite and informative Marmite Loveline (really, it's on 08000 323 656, waiting for all your Marmite queries) Guinness Marmite is still vegan as it's simply a different blend of ingredients already present in Marmite. There's just more Guinness yeast gunk in it, and less yeast gunk from other places.</p>

<p>According to the nutritional information on the jar it apparently contains 0.1 grams less salt than the normal Marmite.</p>

<p>When the jar was opened it definitely smelled different - there was a strong, slightly sour "Guinnessy" odour - but it quickly faded. Replacing the lid for five minutes allowed the odd smell to return, so Unilever aren't just topping the jar with Eau de Guinness.</p>

<p>On toast it tasted almost exactly the same. Doing a taste comparison with normal Marmite I did wonder if 'normal' had a slightly stronger flavour, but soon discovered that trying to taste <em>anything</em> other than just Lots Of Marmite was impossible. Marmite is not a subtle food.</p>

<p>So, to summarise: Guinness Marmite is Marmite with a bit more Guinness, and as a result it has a slight Guinessiness to it. And I've spent ten minutes of my life alternately sniffing two jars of brewing by-product and making thoughtful faces.</p>
