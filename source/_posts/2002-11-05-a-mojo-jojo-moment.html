<p>A shambling group of fat men and boys have just dropped a small arms-dump sized mound of fireworks onto the lawn outside my flat, and are merrily launching fireworks into the air between this block and the next. This gives a lovely amplified <span><strong>BANG</strong></span> as the sound reflects between both buildings. They seem to prefer <strong>BANG</strong> over colours, movement or other firework effects. Including height - the bloody things are exploding on a level with my window.</p>

<p>Curses.</p>
