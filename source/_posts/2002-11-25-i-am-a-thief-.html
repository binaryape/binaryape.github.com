<p>Or so <a href="http://www.anti-leech.com/">these people</a> claim, because I set my <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">web browser</a> to block those infuriating pop-up advert windows that ruin so many websites. The <a href="http://www.anti-leech.com/index.php?option=example&amp;example=banner">Anti-Thief</a> software bars browsers that won't open pop-up windows.</p>

<p>Well, hard luck Anti-Leach. I'm continuing to refuse pop-ups.  I can think of a quite easy way for the Mozilla coders to get around this, and I expect it soon.  People using other browsers will see your adverts, and the clued-up users will avoid the adverts. As most of these adverts only work on the gullible and ignorant, you won't be losing any sales.</p>

<p>My two top pop-up irritations are:</p>

<p>1) The "Warning! Your computer is broadcasting its address" adverts, which use ignorance and fear to sell firewall software. The advert is disguised as a Windows warning message. It makes misleading claims - computers <strong>do not</strong> "broadcast" their IP address across the Internet, and they lie - <strong>my</strong> computer  is not "insecure", certainly when compared with their software. Lancaster University has <a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/iss/a-virus/h-ipbroadcast.htm">a good page on this scam</a>.</p>

<p>2) The plague of <a href="http://www.x10.com/homepage.htm">X10</a> adverts which somehow use sex to sell home automation gadgets. I think they exploit a nerd fantasy in which nubile young women are crazy about men with automatic curtain closing machines and infrared door locks. As far as I know, this isn't true. I bet  their cameras sell well to peeping-toms...</p>

<p>This claim that ignoring an advert is theft is not new.  A  US media spokesman <a href="http://www.2600.com/news/display.shtml?id=1113">recently implied</a> that when TV viewers wait for the adverts to start before making tea or going to the toilet, they are stealing. And fast forwarding past the adverts on a tape or using a PVR, well.</p>

<p>Is this trend a sign that the advertising-funded income model is collapsing, or just that media companies are longer tolerating consumer dissent? Both, I suspect.  More <a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=198">media-consumer crimes</a>.</p>
