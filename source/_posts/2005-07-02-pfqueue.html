<p>I've found <a href="http://pfqueue.sourceforge.net/">PFQueue</a> to be very helpful while trying to clear/redirect the queue of bounced spam bounce messages. Postfix's own mail queue management tools are rather lacking, and although Webmin's queue management is useful, it's nicer to be able to quickly shuffle around 5000 messages at a time from the shell with PFQueue.</p>
