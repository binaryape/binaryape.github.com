<p>Arteth is now a student again, doing an MSc. Helen (sister) is also now a student again, doing an MA. I am not a student again, but I'm compensating by buying more books and CDs. Arteth's course is very intensive and rather expensive, with a huge reading list and a lot of topics to cover in a short time. The emphasis is on practical skills. Helen's studies are more academic and research based, probably involving Europe and terrorism. Less practical skills in this course I hope.</p>
