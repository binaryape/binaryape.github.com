<p>I feel compelled to list my favourite albums of last year.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006UGGX4/qid=1136329909/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_10_1/202-6570647-9177437">Congotronics</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AM4OSC/qid=1136329909/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_10_2/202-6570647-9177437">Congotronics 2</a> - a raw, new musical movement from Kinshasa, featuring distorted electric thumb pianos. Like danceable punk for acid house fans.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000024VK3/qid=1136329870/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/202-6570647-9177437">Acid Brass</a> - an old album I found by accident. Classic late-80s house music played by a brass band, but much more than a gimmick album, this is lovely stuff.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00031TXCC/202-6570647-9177437">Labyrinth</a> - A best of Juno Reactor compilation. Some strange, haunting and beautiful tunes, and some dark powerful goa trance, often at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have to confess I quite enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000024ZAA/202-6570647-9177437">The Best of Johnny Cash</a> too.</p>
