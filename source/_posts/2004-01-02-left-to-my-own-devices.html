<p>Slept, ate, read SF short stories, sat in the bath reading SF short stories, played Mario Kart a bit, read about OOP patterns and refactoring techniques, did a lot of thinking, partially de-crufted Hippo's underbelly, failed to add any visible new features to Hippo, failed to see The Return of The King, watched lots of 'The Two Towers Very Big Edition' on DVD, listened to lots of bhangra, Juno Reactor, Pink Floyd and Clannad, and tried not to worry about the cliff I'm about to plunge over. And a few other things.</p>

<p>All made immeasurably nicer by the presence of A., who is always the best thing about time at home over the Yule break.</p>
