<p>It's easy to blame outside factors when your network systems go a bit odd, but it's a good idea to make sure it really isn't your stuff that's gone decidedly weird first. So this morning, some of my colleagues and I spent a while prodding our DNS servers with a stick* to see why Google, Apple and Yahoo domains kept bouncing up and down. The common factor was that they all used Akamai's DNS.</p>

<p>It looks like our theory was correct: <a href="http://isc.incidents.org/diary.php?date=2004-06-15&amp;isc=d1aa327ef03fb64cbb38ea8235d4f30c">Akamai DNS problem affected large sites</a></p>

<p>The worrying aspect of this is that so many large sites were depending on one company. The title of this Metafilter item is very apt: <a href="http://www.metafilter.org/mefi/33701">A Couple of Large Pieces, Joined at the Hip</a>** Commercial pressures are making the Internet's low level structure too linear and prone to failures, and software and service monocultures (Apache and Bind for instance) are weakening the higher levels.</p>

<p>Or maybe I just worry about these things too much.</p>

<p>(* Not literally.)
