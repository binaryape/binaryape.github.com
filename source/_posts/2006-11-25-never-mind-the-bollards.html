<p>Some antisocial drivers are trying to sneak past Manchester's new automatic bollards and are getting pranged as a result. The bollards block access to <i>almost</i> pedestrianised areas but lower to allow delivery vehicles and buses to pass. Trying to get past by following a bus <a href="http://search.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?tab=av&amp;q=bollards%20manchester&amp;recipe=all&amp;scope=all&amp;edition=d">doesn't work</a>.*</p>

<p>I agree with the Council and hope the bollards stay. This is a case of dangerous drivers damaging their cars and risking injury.</p>

<p>Also the prangs are very funny when they're shown on the local news. This is all good.</p>
