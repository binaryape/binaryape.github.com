<p>After reading <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/dparchives/007999.html">Ben Hammersley's post about body armour</a>, I have to admit I'm strangely tempted too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.engardebodyarmor.com/products/ENGARDE_503_GR.jpg">This one looks good</a>. And available in a <a href="http://www.engardebodyarmor.com/faq.htm">range of colours!</a></p>

<p>Ben goes to places like Afghanistan, and I'm moving to Manchester, which isn't <i>quite</i> the same.</p>
