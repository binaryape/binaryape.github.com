<p>I should have mentioned this ages ago:</p>

<p>In January I wrote to <a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/921.aspx">Network Rail</a> and Manchester City Council asking if they knew <a href="http://www.binary-ape.org/apetracks/archives/2007/01/14/1239/" title="Permanent Link to Missing Invader!">what happened to the Invader mosaic outside Piccadilly Railway Station</a>.</p>

<p>Manchester City Council didn't reply (which I've come to expect) but I can understand that the whereabouts of a space invader mosaic are hardly a priority. If my message wasn't <em>actually</em> a crank email it may well have looked like one.</p>

<p>Network Rail replied almost immediately and passed my query on to the contractor, <a href="http://www.realty-estates.co.uk/">Realty Estates</a>. Realty Estates replied a few days later.</p>

<p>The invader was destroyed during the removal of the concrete base, but Realty Estates said that had they known about the Invader in advance they would have preserved it.</p>

<p>It's a pity the mosaic was lost but not really a big deal - the Invaders are not permanent; the invasion occurred and then the invaders are gradually destroyed one by one.  I appreciate the helpful replies from both companies.</p>

<p>If you notice work going on near an invader it might be a good idea to mention it to the company carrying out the work, just in case.</p>
