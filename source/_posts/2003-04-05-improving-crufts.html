<p>To make Crufts more popular, the organisers should add a competition in which beautiful dogs are whipped until they charge around around a dangerous obstacle course in a tight pack. Every year a number of dogs would die. The organisers would need a special team to rapidly kill any dogs that make a fuss. Otherwise it would be cruel.</p>

<p>The public could watch this on TV, and feel more involved by betting on the outcome. To add a subtle twist, the new style dog show industry should be rotten with fraud, fixes and criminal gangs.</p>

<p>People would love it. After all, they love The Grand National. Only one dead horse this year too.</p>

<p>Yup, a bitter sarcastic rant, but this is a blog after all. I'm cynical enough to believe that most people are opposed to fox hunting, bull fighting, badger baiting and so on only because it's a pleasure-from-killing experience they don't already enjoy.</p>
