<p>The BBC dress up their RSS feeds with XML stylesheets so they're <a href="http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_uk_edition/uk/rss.xml">viewable in a browser</a> as a page that has clear, readable content and a paragraph explaining what it is. This is a excellent  practice; typical users will be confused when faced with raw XML data and assume that something has broken, which, in a way, it has.</p>

<p>I must try to do this.  The BBC are using XSLT, a rather heavy official XML format for transforming XML, but there is also a lighter, simpler alternative: ordinary CSS. Ben Hamersley has  written a quick intro to using CSS to present XML on OReillyNet.</p>
