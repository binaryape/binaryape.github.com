<p>I'm running the Mandrake Cooker XFree86 4.2.99 packages, and the new cursors are just horrible. Mac OS X does shadowed mouse pointers very well.  My XFree86 is <i>not</i> doing them well. The 'insert text' pointer is the worst - it looks like a stain on the monitor. How do I get rid of them?</p>
