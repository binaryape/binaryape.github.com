<p>Long ago I read that in the Far East, people refer to "the rabbit in the moon", not "the man in the moon". Ever since then I've tried to see the rabbit, and eventually I thought I'd worked it out.</p>

<p>I was wrong - <i>my</i> rabbit was facing the wrong way, at least when compared the the Japanese rabbit, who is busy making mochi. Mmm, mochi.</p>
