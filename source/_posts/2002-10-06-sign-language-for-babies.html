<p>Chomsky was right that language is hard-wired into humans, but it seems that non-verbal communication is just as much part of human language as verbal communication. There's <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/8F23.html">a Simpsons episode</a> where Maggie's baby noises are translated by a machine into simple speech. This is better: babies as young as six months old can communicate with sign language. The language areas of a baby's brain are  functioning long before the vocal cords develop enough for speech.</p>

<pre><code>    This is very impressive. What sort of impact will this have on a child's mental development? How will this change people's attitudes to non-human signers like &lt;a href="http://www.koko.org/"&gt;Koko&lt;/a&gt; and the teaching of sign language in general?
