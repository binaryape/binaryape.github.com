<p>I used to be crazy about <a href="http://www.faq.msxnet.org/msxgeneral.html#whatmsx">MSX computers</a>, back in the 8bit 1980s. This Internet radio station shows that there are still people who are crazy about MSX computers. Or just crazy: streaming MSX game music, and even weirder, remixes and covers of MSX game music. If you want a "stadium rock" remix of <a href="http://website.lineone.net/~lineup/st-games/Konami.html">"Antarctic Adventure"</a>, this is the place.</p>
