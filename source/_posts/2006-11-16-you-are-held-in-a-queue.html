<p>This weblog has been very busy in the last three months, but sadly that mainly involves hundreds and hundreds of spam comments stacked up in a moderation queue. Don't they even bother to check if the comments are being blocked? Grrr. Anyway, as a result, if you did post a comment it's in the list somewhere, and I'll tidy things up eventually. I'm going to either add some sort of fancy Bayesian filtering/blacklist plugin thing or just make the comments "member-only".</p>

<p>The same problem applies to email. I managed to get a backlog of 14,000 emails at my ISP, again mostly spam.</p>
