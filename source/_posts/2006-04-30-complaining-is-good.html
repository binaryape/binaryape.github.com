<p>I think writing letters of complaint and/or nitpicking might be my new hobby</p>

Dear BBC,

I'm uncomfortable with your use of the word "leftist". This isn't a word commonly used in the UK, but in the USA it is *not* a neutral term. "Left-wing" or "Socialist" would be a more neutral term.

In the USA "leftist" is effectively a derogatory term. There is no "rightist", as such views are assumed to be normal, safe and good. "Leftist" implies that people or organisations have abnormal, dangerous ideologies. A Google search for "leftist" shows it is used negatively in an overwhelming number of cases, and when used positively it's usually in a "reclaiming" or ironic context.

The USA's mainstream media *does* have a bias, please don't repeat it.

Please adjust your styleguide!

Yes, I have nothing better to do this morning :-)

<p>Of course, in this case at least two of the leaders involved <b>are</b> rather <i>unusual</i>.</p>
