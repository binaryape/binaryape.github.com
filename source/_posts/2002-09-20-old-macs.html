<p>I've got a <a href="http://lowendmac.net/compact/plus.shtml">Mac Plus</a>, a <a href="http://lowendmac.net/compact/se.shtml">Mac SE</a> with A4 monitor, and an <a href="http://lowendmac.net/quadra/q605.shtml">LC475</a>. I'm not sure why. I've been looking for a cheap localtalk to ethernet adapter for years, and now I've got it, I can't remember if I ever had a practical use for it. Still, it's fun to <a href="http://www.atpm.com/8.06/networking.shtml">wire up a 16 year old Mac to a modern network</a>. Sadly I don't have enough room for all the old kit I've collected. Getting rid of the <a href="http://www.machine-room.org/computers/14/">Acorn A5000</a> is an easy choice, but which Mac should I eBay away?</p>
