<p>I found this page earlier today while looking for pictures of tempeh (yes, I know) and it conveniently helped solve the mystery of the stuff left at the bottom of the pan when making soy milk, and the stuff floating at the top.</p>

<p>In Japanese the stuff at the bottom is called okara (doesn't look good) and the skin at the top, when dried, is called yuba. Mmm.</p>
