<p>Quite a nice tutorial on basic use of Unix via a command line interface. A few mistakes here and there, but a good introduction overall. However, <strong>never</strong> use telnet to log in to another computer over the Internet. In fact, I'd recommend avoiding any computer that has telnet login enabled, as it's been very badly configured.  Use a <a href="http://www.openssh.org">secure shell</a> instead.</p>
