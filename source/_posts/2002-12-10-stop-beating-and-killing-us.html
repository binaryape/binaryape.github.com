<p>UN workers in Israel and the Occupied Territories <a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/un-petition.htm">politely ask the Israeli military stop "beating and killing" them</a>. This isn't news, but Cherie Blair blubbing was on Channel 4 news five, maybe six times today.</p>

<p>The murder of Ian Hook, shot in the back by an Israeli sniper while he was inside a UN compound, and then prevented from getting medical aid, is an absolute disgrace. Enough people are being killed by terrorists already, without state terrorism too.</p>
