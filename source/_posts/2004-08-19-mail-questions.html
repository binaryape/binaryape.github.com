<p>Is Manchester's postal delivery service particularly bad, or is it just that Newcastle's is quite good?</p>

<p>How can a "First Class" parcel take over five days (still counting...) to be delivered to a central Manchester address?</p>

<ul>
<li>Despite appearances Manchester is quite a distant and difficult place to find</li>
<li>The postman has just left the parcel next to the building's front door as he did last time*, only this time someone has stolen it</li>
<li>Because I complained about that, the parcel is on a shelf labelled "Wait a week"</li>
<li>Since <a href="http://momorgan.com/archives/2004/07/13/7eea696a72e64cb69dcf6376dc9f64d0/">First Class is the new Second Class</a>, it's just been lost</li>
<li><a href="http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/news/s/127/127138_letters_dumped_in_bin_by_a_temp_.html">It's in a dog-dirt bin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To answer the question, I've talked to friends and relatives in Manchester, and it does look as if residential deliveries aren't particularly good, particularly for flat-dwellers.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="http://momorgan.com/archives/2004/07/13/7eea696a72e64cb69dcf6376dc9f64d0/">another late/lost presents rant.</a></p>

<ul>
<li>I was at home too - he didn't bother to ring the bell, or leave it with a neighbour. Or leave a card in my postbox saying "Left parcel next to front door where about 100 people will walk past it". I just happened to notice it when I was leaving.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still, <a href="http://scaryduck.blogspot.com/2004/08/mirth-and-woe-ducks-brother-writes.html">it might eventually arrive. At least I've not broken my rib</a>.</p>

<p>[Victor Meldew style rants are now only permitted when supported by something vaguely useful or informative, or just a couple of links.]</p>

<p><b>Update:</b>
Mea culpa, a bit. I have now got the parcel: there was a letter in my postbox today (Friday) saying that they'd tried to deliver it on Monday. I'd given up waiting on Monday as I needed to go shopping, and left at about 4.40pm. Delivery turned up around 4.50pm. Grrrr. So it was fast, it just wasn't left with the block management or neighbours, and I wasn't told until four days later. I also got a letter for a business down the road today.</p>
