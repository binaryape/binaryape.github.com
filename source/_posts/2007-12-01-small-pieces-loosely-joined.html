I hate breaking hyperlinks but I'm at it again: this weblog is moving to another host, with slightly different URLs.  I'll redirect some of the old links for a month or so. The new Apetracks will be available at <a href="http://apetracks.binary-ape.org">http://apetracks.binary-ape.org</a>. If you're using the <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a> feed then that will continue to work.

Until now I've been maintaining the software myself,  hosting first on <a href="http://34sp.com">34sp.com</a> using <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MoveableType</a>, then binary-ape.org moved to <a href="http://textdrive.com">Textdrive</a>, using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> for the blog. Running the blog software yourself gives a lot freedom to customise, freedom from AUPs, and probably more freedom of speech. But it also requires a fair bit of maintenance. I've barely been updating the blog comments recently, so the overhead of regular Wordpress upgrades is just too much work.  The current spate of self-hosted Wordpress blogs being compromised has emphasised this. I work as a sysadmin during the day, and maintaining PHP apps in my own time isn't my idea of fun anymore, so I'm going to migrate Apetracks over to <a href="http://typepad.com">Typepad</a>.

I attended a very interesting conference on OpenID recently. One theme that persisted across the presentations was the idea that it can be much more effective to use a variety of specialised online services rather than a single all-in-one provider. I've been singing the praises of 'loose coupling' and toolchains for a long time, and I think it's time to apply this to my Internet services too. As well as moving my blogs to a commercial blog provider, and moving my mail to <a href="http://fastmail.fm">Fastmail.fm</a>, and I've signed up with <a href="http://slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> to provide a VPS for messing about. DNS is already with the excellent <a href="http://nettica.com">Nettica</a> It's going to cost more than staying with <a href="http://textdrive.com">Textdrive</a> but hopefully I'll get a lot more functionality for less effort, and not <em>too</em> much money.

Of course, I might regret this if the US dollar recovers...
