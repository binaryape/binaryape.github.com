<p>I've been 'tagged' to answer a series of questions <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4yn67.o5fqfcOqsWbmqL?p=196">by a friend</a>, so I will.</p>

<p><strong>Four Jobs I have had:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Dustbinman and street cleaner in the Midlands: I've eaten lunch sitting next to a very dead sheep and been hit by juice from an exploding cat. It was very 'character building'.</li>
    <li>Multimedia Content Coordinator in the North East: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.</li>
    <li>Systems Administrator in the North East: Learned a lot, found I was prevented from using much of what I learned.</li>
    <li>Systems Administrator in the North West:  I can now use what I've learned, and learn more. A near perfect job, I love it.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Four Movies I could watch over and over:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>'Princess Mononoke'. Try to see with eyes unclouded.</li>
    <li>'Fong Sai Yuk'. Jet Li's finest.</li>
    <li>'Star Wars Episode 4'. (Fortunately for domestic harmony) With Han shooting first.</li>
    <li>The Matrix. I know, I know... but it has hidden subtlety and skillful violence. Really.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Four Places I have lived:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Warwickshire. Grew up in a large rural village. The county of Shakespeare, George Eliot, Tolkien. All dead. Probably not as bad as I thought it was.</li>
    <li>Manchester. A dirty and exciting city. First lived here as a student, then returned 12 years later.</li>
    <li>Missouri. Stayed with my girlfriend's family. It's a nice place with nice people.</li>
    <li>Newcastle upon Tyne. Lived in a nice street in a less than nice area, it's greatly improving since I left. I miss the fresh air of Newcastle, and the great people I worked with.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Four TV shows I love to watch:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>'Firefly'</li>
    <li>'Lost'</li>
    <li>'Channel 4 News'</li>
    <li>'Ultraviolet' (short-lived 90s series, but still the best ever TV vampires)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Four places I have been on vacation:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Lyme Regis, South West UK</li>
    <li>Keswick, Lake District, UK</li>
    <li>Kristiansand, Norway</li>
    <li>Chicago, USA</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Four blogs I visit daily:</strong></p>

<p>I use RSS feeds so  I don't really visit them daily, but these spring to mind:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://fafblog.blogspot.com">Fafblog</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://5thnovember.blogspot.com">Guy Fawkes</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://randomreality.blogware.com">Random Acts of Reality</a></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Four favorite foods:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Dark chocolate.</li>
    <li>Rooibosch tea</li>
    <li>Fried tempeh (any fried edible plant really. Aubergine. Chillis. Doughnuts.)</li>
    <li>Saurkraut</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Four Places I would Rather Be:</strong></p>

<p>I can't really answer this one. Here more?</p>

<p><strong>Four Albums I can‚Äôt live without:</strong>
I could live without <em>all</em> albums, but here's four I like:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld, The Orb</li>
    <li>A Collection of Great Dance Songs, Pink Floyd</li>
    <li>Drukqs, Aphex Twin</li>
    <li>Converting Vegetarians, Infected Mushroom</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Four Vehicles I have owned:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>A large red pedal-powered pickup truck, with a little crane thing I think.</li>
    <li>A very heavy wooden sledge.</li>
    <li>A very, very heavy wooden go-kart (the sort with pram wheels)</li>
    <li>A raft that I helped build, and which sank mid-journey.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point I should 'tag' four other bloggers I know. Unfortunately the only two I know well are the ones who passed this to me, so this is a leaf node. It goes no further. Just like me.</p>
