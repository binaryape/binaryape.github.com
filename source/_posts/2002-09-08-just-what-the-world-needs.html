<p>"More blogs! More Blogs!" chanted the crowds in every street. What could I do but give in to their demands?</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>I recently realised that a couple of times a day I think "If I had a blog, I'd link to that/write about that/bore people with that." I tend to send a lot of very short emails containing "interesting" links, too. So I've decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>If you want to see the blogs that inspired me to start doing this (with another million people), look at sites like <a href="http://haddock.org">Haddock</a>, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">Boing Boing</a> and <a href="http://www.linux.org.uk/diary/">Alan Cox</a> and <a href="http://www.linux.org.uk/~telsa/Diary/diary.html">Telsa's</a> diaries.</p>
