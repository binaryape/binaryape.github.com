Oolong <a href="http://sokaisha.hp.infoseek.co.jp/passing.htm">died</a> a few years ago.</p><p>I was recently very happy to stumble upon <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heavenair/">Fusuke-pon</a>, another adventurous Japanese rabbit. He doesn&#39;t balance pancakes but he appears in some lovely photographs, also often in parks and temples.</p>
