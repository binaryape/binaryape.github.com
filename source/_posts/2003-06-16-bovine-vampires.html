<p>If you feed cow milk to calves, there's less cow milk for people to drink. So it pays to feed the calves on as little real milk as possible. In the USA, young cows are fed on a "milk substitute" made from the blood of other cows. And when they get older, they've got some tasty reprocessed dog food too.</p>
