<p>These fellows are <i>good</i><i>.</i></p>

<p>I'm going to be a heretic now: the Jedi fight scenes in the original Star Wars movies are rather feeble, especially in Episide IV. Vader and Kenobi are obviously rather out-of-practice and just tired of it all. If the fight had gone on for a little while longer they would both have agreed to a sit down and a nice cup of tea instead.</p>
