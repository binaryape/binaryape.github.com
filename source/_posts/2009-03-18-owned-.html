After a few conversations with colleagues I'm now worried that software I create at home might end up owned by my employer - my personal coding projects tend to overlap with the same areas I work in. In my original employment terms I had default 'IP' rights, but I'm not so sure now... I don't want my hobby coding to turn into more unpaid overtime.

Fortunately, since I stopped the silly overtime habit I've not managed to actually do anything productive at home in its place (progress in Eve Online probably doesn't count), but I need to find out what the situation is before I stop procrastinating. I also need to actually click 'publish' on this blog more often.
