<p>My plan to do a rough, hacked-together set of scripts to make something that looked like my planned Hippo project this weekend didn't work out - I ended up trying to write the real thing instead. It doesn't do anything useful yet, but it does do it properly.</p>

<p>I've also been getting up early every day for weeks, getting in to work early, leaving work as soon as I can, doing housework immediately, watching the Simpsons, not dressing quite as scruffily as usual, drinking lots of <a href="http://www.sallys-place.com/beverages/tea/yogi_tea.htm">Yogi Tea</a>, eating more <a href="http://www.greenandblacks.com/">chocolate</a>, reading more.  I don't really know why - despite my colleagues' theories, I'm neither attending job interviews yet or having/planning an affair.</p>

<p>It could be a virus I suppose. I think I like it.</p>
