<p>Who else is better qualified to investigate the failure of US intelligence agencies in the Trade Centre attack? If you want an expert on international terrorism, you can't do better than choose Henry Kissinger,  one of the top terrorists of the 20th Century.  From simple assassinations, through coups and wars to full blown genocide, he knows his subject. Top quality choice from Bush. Not quite the best way to win support worldwide, though.</p>

<p>So, to celebrate this return of a great historical figure, I present the <a href="http://www.stone-dead.asn.au/albums-cds/lyrics/henry-kissinger.html">Monty Python song "Henry Kissinger"</a>, and two summaries of this macabre event, <a href="http://slate.msn.com/?id=2074678">one from a journalist</a>, and <a href="http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/war17.html">one from a cartoonist</a>.</p>
