<p>Judging by the 6,000 bounced spam messages rattling around in my mail router's queue, all addressed to blatantly made up "people" at binary-ape.org, my domain is being used to fake the 'From' addresses of thousands of nasty spam emails offering penis medicines to fundamentally stupid people.</p>

<p>It really is astonishing that people can give their credit card details to sites with randomly generated URLs like "ftqolspstmtleil.com.r1vpvibat2rpsu9.[-censored-]", with the aim of actually using the 'medicine'.</p>

<p>I don't think much can be done to save email. Even adding new antispam measures like <a href="http://spf.pobox.com/">SPF</a> will do little to help, unless there is an organised movement to simply drop all messages sent without adequate safeguards. SMTP email, as used today, has to be abandoned.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://jabber.org">XMPP/Jabber</a> protocols, although never meant to replace SMTP, could easily do the job with only a few, simple extensions to the existing set.</p>
