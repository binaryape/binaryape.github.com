<p>Someone has done a great job researching which American fast food chains have food suitable for vegans. Overall the situation isn't great, but in many cases this isn't really surprising: should a steakhouse be expecting vegans?</p>

<p>If you're looking for the most available chain with decent options (not just salad), it looks like Taco Bell is still the best bet.</p>
