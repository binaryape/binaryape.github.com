<p>From  this <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2877439.stm'>BBC News article</a> today:</p>

<p>"Elsewhere, four heavy bombs have been dropped by US planes in northern areas controlled by the extremist Islamist group Ansar al-Islam, which is suspected of having links with the al-Qaeda network. "</p>

<p>Ansar al-Islam <a href='http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/mena/ansarbk020503.htm'>do not seem to be a particularly pleasant group of people</a>, but the first significant aspect of this attack is that they're Kurdish nationalists.  So now Turkey attacks Kurds, Iran attacks Kurds, Iraq attack Kurds, and the US attacks Kurds.</p>

<p>This group contains many veterans of the war against the USSR in Afghanistan. What are the odds that this was yet another US funded terrorist group?</p>

<p>The other interesting aspect of this, of course, is that the US is yet again preemptively attacking because it 'suspects' something.</p>

<p>All this makes the US attack rather dangerous, I think.</p>
