<p>I like using naming schemes for network resources; using names like "BF7689UUG4" and "Printer8" is not only dull, they're less memorable. It's also a good thing to give related objects related names - all the printers named after Greek Gods, all the firewalls named after planets, that sort of thing. It makes the network a more human environment.</p>

<p>It's nice to see that IKEA do something similar with their famously odd product names.</p>
