<p>Scott Tyrrell is not only a great animator and artist, he's now an award-winning performance poet too. He's just won the annual <a href="http://www.bristol2008.com/171.asp">Bristol Poetry Slam</a> individual prize, and his group "Poetry Vandals" won the the team prize. I have a Tux penguin that once starred with Scott in a play.</p>
