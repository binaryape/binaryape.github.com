<p>I never met <a href="http://www.pgmillard.com/blog/">Peter Millard</a> but I've liked and respected him for years, as a nice, interesting guy and a talented pioneer of Jabber technology. Peter recently both overcame cancer and become a father. It came as quite a shock to read that he has suddenly died from complications resulting from his cancer treatment.</p>
