<p>This is a photo I took today of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_(fish)">pike</a> in a Manchester canal.<br />
<br />
Before spotting the pike I'd been reading 'A Wizard of Earthsea', in which the main character's 'true name' is Ged. According to Wikipedia an old English name for pike is &quot;ged&quot;. A nice coincidence.<br />
<br />
Many years ago I got to eat some pike caught in a Warwickshire river, cooked with lemon juice. It tasted like river mud with lemon juice. <br />
<br />
(I've just remembered how much sewage ended up in that river. Bleugh.)
