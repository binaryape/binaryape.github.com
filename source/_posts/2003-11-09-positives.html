<p>A. and I went off to visit family in Nuneaton recently. I haven't been to Nuneaton for a long time, and it was strange to be back. The main street  has an amazing concentration of mobile phone shops. The old Tandy shop, the place I saw my first computer, has vanished.</p>

<p>Nuneaton has a surprisingly good range of health food shops - the small town centre has at least three decent shops, including of course a <a href="http://www.hollandandbarrett.com/">Hollands and Barrets</a> who seem originate from Nuneaton. One of the other two shops had a great range of food, and lots of hippie nicknacks too. Nuneaton's park is much smaller than I remember (a side effect of me being over six foot tall now, I suppose) but was pleasant to wander around, and absolutely packed with almost fearless squirrels. George Elliot's statue seems to have moved, I'm sure it used to be in the park.</p>

<p>The main problem I had while upgrading systems to Mandrake 9.2 was that my Netgear router failed on the same weekend, forcing some rapid routing adjustments to restore internet connectivity, and a complete loss of wireless. My Apple Airport wireless router failed after just a year too. The  Airport had a one year warranty, and was stupidly expensive to repair, so I replaced  it with the Netgear FM114P. Fortunately the Netgear had a free three year warranty. After a long wait on hold they immediately sent me a new one. I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.netgear.co.uk/">Netgear</a>, their kit is good and their warranty support is good. D-Link seem to losing their quality control and sturdy design, and I'm tired of their non-standard power adapters failing. <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/69/33858.html">Belkin appear to have gone stark staring mad</a> and created a router that randomly chooses to supply users with adverts rather than the requested data.</p>
