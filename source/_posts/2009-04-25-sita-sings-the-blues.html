This shot of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravana">effigy of Ravana</a> is my most viewed photograph, with almost 2500 hits at the time of writing. It got so many hits not because it's a particularly good photo, but because Yahoo used it on a special page for Diwali Mela last year. They may have chosen it because of the link I included to Nina Paley's wonderful Battle of Lanka scene: <a href="http://ia301128.us.archive.org/1/items/Sita04_BattleofLanka/Sita04_BattleofLanka_sorensen.mov">You will not see finer demon vs monkey combat.</a> (This is an early version of the scene)

Nina Paley has now finished the entire <a href="http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/">Sita Sings The Blues</a> movie and is about to start pressing DVDs. As well as being a great animation (with a marvelous soundtrack by early Jazz star Annette Hanshaw), the production of the movie has highlighted many problems with the current copyright regime, and turned Nina into a leading campaigner for copyright reform.

<p>While I was at the Jain event last week one of the speakers mentioned Rama's hunting of the deer, as described in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana">Ramayana</a>. I haven't read any of the Indian classics yet, but I knew of this legend from watching Nina's film.</p>

You can <a href="http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/wiki/index.php?title=SitaSites" title="SitaSites">legally download the entire movie in various formats</a>, and a special DVD edition will soon be available. Here's a low quality version on GoogleVideo:
