<p>I'll probably not get to <a href="http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/home.asp">this extraordinary exhibition</a> in London, I just can't afford the journey. It's a pity the website offers little beyond advertising.</p>

<p>The website for the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/dreamanatomy/index.html">Dream Anatomy</a> exhibition at  the U.S. National Library of Medicine is much better, with many marvelous, high quality images. It's an online edition of the exhibition.</p>
