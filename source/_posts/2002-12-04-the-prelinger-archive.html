<p>A collection of "ephemeral" short films from the '40s, '50s and '60s America. The collection includes unintentionally hilarious advice on the dangers of "parking", racist wartime propaganda, pompous adverts, bad sex education,  and the joys of atomic power.  Real, but very close to the spoof versions that appear in 'The Simpsons'</p>
