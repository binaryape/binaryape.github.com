<p>I've finally got round to setting myself up with some <a href="http://www.openpgp.org/">OpenPGP-compatible</a> keys, so that I can securely sign and encrypt emails and files. This is something that scares the USA and UK governments, as they like to spy on their citizens.  The German government has a better attitude - they are actually <a href="http://www.gnupg.de/presse.en.html">funding development of this technology</a>.</p>

<p>I'm using <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/gnupg.html">Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG)</a>, which is compatible with the famous and commercial PGP software via the Open PGP standard, and <a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org/">Enigmail</a>, which signs, encrypts and decrypts emails in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> and Netscape.</p>

<p>In the end it wasn't at all difficult - GPG's <a href="http://webber.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto-1.html">Mini-Howto</a>  and <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#INTRO">Manual</a> make it all clear. I've still got to try a few things, but I've tested all the main tasks.</p>

<p>Just in case anyone wants it, here's <a href="http://www.binary-ape.org/keys/binaryape.pgp">my public key</a>.</p>
