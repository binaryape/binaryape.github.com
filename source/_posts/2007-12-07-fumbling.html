I'm over-cautious and clumsy at the best of times. I've got a second camera lens now and changing them resembles a small-scale surgical operation, with various lids and bits laid out on a flat surface or balanced on bags. I felt like I needed an extra arm. Or a camera strap, I've just realised. I suspect I should worry less.
