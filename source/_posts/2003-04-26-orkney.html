<p>I've wanted to visit Orkney ever since I was about 6 and saw a school TV programme about ancient villages buried under sand, despite the programme being rather spooky. I think the programme was a dramatisation of <a href="http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/skarabrae/index.html">Skara Brae's history</a>.</p>

<p>This is a great site, full of folklore and history.</p>
