I'm a scruffy semi-bearded man who takes photographs of everyday things, usually wearing boots, baffling t-shirts and a hat. I often get puzzled looks from people: "Why is that man taking a photo of a wall?". I don't mind.

I expect to be reported as a terrorist at some point if <a href="http://www.nickpotter.net/upload/ct_camera_2008-3.pdf">this stupid campaign</a> spreads from London to Manchester: "That man is taking pictures of a bus shelter! Call the police!" That's something I do mind.

<strong>Update: </strong>Austin Mitchell MP (a keen photographer himself) is going to raise this issue with the Home Office. <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/04/12/help-uk-member-of-pa.html">More at BoingBoing.net.</a> It's probably worth sending a letter or email to your local MP.
