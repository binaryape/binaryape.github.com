<p>I'm still hooked on the <a href="http://www9.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/wildcamafrica/wildcam.html">Pete's Pond Wildcam</a>.</p>

<p>Breakfast watching the baboons and deer, and Fatty the croc sunbathing, a lunchtime glimpse of  warthogs digging up the bank to make better mud, and regularly checking in the evening, just in case something has wandered over for a nocturnal drink or wallow.</p>

<p>Here are some elephants I 'photographed'.</p>
