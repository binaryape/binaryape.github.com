<p>I'm English, and partial to a "traditional"* breakfast and fried bread, but I can't keep up with A. I've managed to cook enough of the stuff at once to discover that she does have a limit, but it was a truly awe-inspiring experiment.</p>

<p>This marvelous site is all about fried breads from around the world, from the humble doughnut to the You Tiao of China and the native American/Scottish fry-bread or bannock. You'll probably need a mug of tea after looking at the site.</p>

<p>(* Not quite traditional in my case, with me being a vegan.)</p>
