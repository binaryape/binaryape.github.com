<blockquote>So what did you do on your Newtonmas Holidays? Made a New
         Year's Resolution to foment revolution, possibly using your
         cool decentralised reputation-management idea, which this
         year you'll be writing in OCaml or maybe Ruby?</blockquote>

<p>I'm a little disturbed by the 100% accuracy of that. Is this the <a href="http://www.lazyweb.org">LazyWeb</a> at work again? Is everyone else doing this too, all at once? Should I just sit back and let the LazyWeb provide? Or will everybody think that, leaving me to save the world? I certainly hope not. All I've got is a lot of incoherent scribbles, and some Ruby books.</p>
