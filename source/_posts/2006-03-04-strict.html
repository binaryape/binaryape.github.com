<p>I'm irked by the phrase "strict diet" used to describe people who only eat organic food, or vegetarians. "Strict" makes it sound joyless and limited. If someone refused to eat stale food contaminated with dog poo they wouldn't be described as having a "strict diet", and avoiding bland food contaminated with pesticides is no different. Well, it probably doesn't smell like dog poo, but that's over extending my rather weak metaphor...</p>
