<p>Plodding on for a couple of hours every night now, and enjoying it immensely. Somehow, refactoring code is a nice way to spend an evening. Not the nicest, I hasten to add. I'm learning a lot, and Hippo is looking good inside and out.</p>

<p>Hippo isn't quite a Content Management System (CMS). It's more about meta-content than content, but it's inspired by great software such as those listed on the sites below:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cmsinfo.org/">CMSInfo</a> - a site listing many Open Source CMS systems.
<a href="http://www.opensourcecms.com/"> Open Source CMS</a> - another OSS CMS portal</p>

<p>In particular Hippo is influenced by the sadly relicensed <a href="http://www.metadot.com">Metadot</a> and the absolutely wonderful <a href="http://www.plainblack.com/">WebGUI</a>. It'll do things rather differently though - Hippo has a different role.  In fact, I'm wondering if I can get it to work alongside WebGUI...</p>
