<p>There's now a brand new Jacob Dimbleby in the world. Possibly a Jakob, as I'm not sure about the spelling. Congratulations to Alison and Martin!</p>

<p>I've really got to get my proper uncle behaviour sorted out now - I've not been a particularly good uncle so far. Mysterious Uncle, yes.</p>

<p>I'm not posting the traditional weblog baby photos, MPEGs or Quicktime VR files, nor does Jacob yet have a FOAF file or PGP key. Just a Google entry by now. First one, too.</p>

<p>And now, a link for Alison: <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994183">Buffalo-sized guinea pig revealed</a></p>

<p>That stuff about baby metadata is meant to be ironic/satirical, it really is. Honest.</p>
