<p>I think the quality of spam is actually declining. Today I've had a number of spam messages that have completely scrambled content - just a mess of shattered and mixed random characters and html. How is that going to sell me something?</p>

<p>Other spam messages that <i>could</i> have tricked me into opening them ruined their chances by appending random text to the otherwise valid looking subject. How gullible do they think people are?</p>

<p>If someone tried to sell you a mortgage after pretending to be someone else, would you buy it? It's difficult to believe that anyone would, but judging by the number of these messages, it must be working - spamming has costs, and if it didn't make money, it wouldn't happen. There must be an awful lot of stupid people out there.</p>

<p>Best spam sales pitch of the week:  "Pete, make money in your underwear!"</p>

<p>I certainly don't believe that.</p>
